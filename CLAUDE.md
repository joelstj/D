## 1. What this is

A cohesive product assembled from four components (each still buildable and
testable on its own):

| Dir | Was | Language | Role |
|-----|-----|----------|------|
| `engine/` | Python-Engine-L2-s (`l2arb`) | Python 3.11–3.12 | **Detection** engine — watches L2 DEX state, emits ranked arbitrage opportunities. Detection only. |
| `ingestion/` | L2_bots (`l2-ingest`) | Rust 1.94 | **Data feed** — reads 5 L2s (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Unichain, Ink), POSTs state to the engine, fans ranked opps out over WebSocket. |
| `contracts/` | L2_on-chain | Solidity 0.8.20 | **Execution target** — atomic flash-loan arbitrage executor (profit-or-revert). The gated, human-authorised endpoint. |
| `dashboard/` | L2-GUI | Node + React | **UI + API** — live opportunities, wired settings, MetaMask, paper/live executor split. |
| `launcher/` | *(new)* | Python (stdlib) | **Orchestrator** — installs, wires, runs, and supervises the whole stack; payload of the `.exe`. |
| `scripts/`, `docs/`, `.github/` | *(new)* | — | `.exe` build, docs, CI. |

The end-to-end data flow (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for detail):

```
ingestion ──POST /detect──▶ engine ──ranked opps──▶ ingestion ──ws :9001──▶
  dashboard backend (ExternalProvider) ──REST + /ws──▶ dashboard UI
                                                          │ POST /api/execute/:id
                                                          ▼  (paper by default)
                                                       contracts (gated, human-only)
```

---

## 2. Safety invariants (inherited from every component — binding)

These come from the four component constitutions and **override any impulse to
move faster**. Breaking one is a correctness/safety regression.

1. **Only real, on-chain-verifiable data in runtime paths.** No synthetic,
   random, hard-coded, or "example" market data anywhere a shipped artifact can
   reach it. Synthetic data lives only in clearly-marked tests. Every quote is
   block-stamped and traceable. (engine §3, ingestion prime-directive 1.)
2. **The engine is a detector, not a trader.** It holds no keys, signs nothing,
   submits no transactions. No MEV *extraction* (sandwiching/front-running).
3. **Execution is gated and paper-by-default.** The dashboard ships
   `EXECUTION_MODE=paper` + `autoExecute=false`; `LiveExecutor` refuses to
   broadcast. The safe contract-integration pattern is **simulate via
   `staticCall`, then hand an unsigned tx to a human-authorised signer** — the
   loop never broadcasts and never deploys. (contracts golden rules 2, 5.)
4. **Never fake a test green** — no deleting, skipping, `xfail`, or loosening an
   assertion to pass. A test that legitimately can't run is recorded as BLOCKED
   with a concrete reason, never faked. (ingestion prime-directive 3.)
5. **Leave the tree green.** Every commit passes the touched component's gate
   (below). Never commit secrets or `.env`.
6. **No secrets in code or git.** Endpoints/keys come from the environment or
   config files; only `*.example` is tracked.
7. **`verified` honesty.** Never emit stale/unproven state as `verified:true`.

If a task appears to cross lines 1–3 (e.g. "make the loop send a live trade",
"seed the dashboard with fake opportunities"), **stop, do not implement it**, and
record the concern rather than faking it.

---

## 3. The wiring (what "merged" means concretely)

The components already spoke a common contract; the merge makes them one product:

- **Seam A — ingestion → engine (pre-existing):** `l2-ingest` POSTs a
  `DetectRequest` to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/detect`; the engine returns ranked
  `DetectResponse`. Configured in `ingestion` `[engine]`.
- **Seam B — ingestion → dashboard (built here):** `l2-ingest` broadcasts a
  versioned `Envelope { kind:"opportunities", payload: DetectResponse }` as NDJSON
  WebSocket frames on `:9001`. A new **`ExternalProvider`**
  (`dashboard/backend/src/arbitrage/providers/external.ts`) consumes it, maps each
  engine opportunity onto the dashboard's `ArbitrageOpportunity` shape
  (`providers/engineMap.ts`), and feeds the engine's pull-based scan loop. Select
  it with `DATA_SOURCE=external` + `INGEST_FEED_URL`.
- **Seam C — dashboard → contracts (gated):** `POST /api/execute/:id` runs the
  paper executor by default. Live execution targets
  `contracts/FlashLoanArbitrage.sol::executeArbitrage(ArbParams)` and stays
  human-authorised (see invariant 3).
- **Orchestration:** `launcher/` starts engine + ingestion + dashboard, serves the
  UI single-origin (`SERVE_STATIC_DIR`), health-gates startup, opens the browser,
  and then runs a continuous **health monitor** (a live HUD, `launcher/l2arb/health.py`)
  that probes each service's process + `/health`, self-diagnoses faults, and
  self-heals by restarting a crashed/wedged process with backoff and a bounded
  restart budget — infra recovery only, never touching the human-gated execution
  path. `docker-compose.yml` is the container alternative.

The mapper is **honest about units**: engine amounts are numeraire base units;
they read as USD only when the numeraire is a stablecoin — no ETH price is
fabricated (`engineMap.ts` docstring). `profitBps`/`confidence`/route are always
exact.

- **Latency health (cross-cutting):** a per-batch latency trace rides the pipeline
  — the engine returns a `timing` block on `/detect`, the ingestion envelope adds a
  `latency` field with a single-host wall-clock `origin_wall_ms` anchor, and the
  dashboard aggregates rolling per-stage stats (2–5 per component) + the end-to-end
  at `GET /api/latency`/`/ws` and renders the *Pipeline Latency* HUD. A **separate**
  read-only probe times on-chain execution readiness at `GET /api/health/execution`
  — RPC + optional `staticCall`, **never** a signer/broadcast (invariant 3). Latency
  is measured elapsed time, never fabricated; end-to-end is labelled single-host
  wall clock. Design: `docs/LATENCY.md`.

- **Configuration (cross-cutting):** all env-based config lives in **one master
  `.env` at the repo root** (`.env.example` is the tracked template). The engine
  (`L2ARB__` prefix, via `config._discover_env_files`), the dashboard backend +
  Vite frontend (`dashboard/backend/src/config/env.ts`, `frontend/vite.config.ts`
  `envDir`), and the contracts deploy tooling (`contracts/hardhat.config.js`) all
  read it automatically. Precedence: real env vars → component-local `.env`
  (optional override) → the master → built-in defaults. The Rust ingestion layer
  is the exception — it is TOML-configured (`config.toml`), not env-driven. The
  Blockscout verification oracle takes **only** an API key
  (`L2ARB__BLOCKSCOUT__API_KEY`); its per-chain endpoints are built into the engine
  (`config.BLOCKSCOUT_REST_BASES`). Deploy secrets (`contracts` `PRIVATE_KEY`) are
  fenced in the master and read only by the human-gated deploy step, never the
  running detection stack.

---

## 4. Git & branch discipline

- **Working branch: `claude/l2-arbitrage-flash-loan-bot-embzav`** (this repo, `D`).
- One logical change → one clear commit. Never commit a red tree, secrets, or
  build artifacts (`.gitignore` covers venvs, `node_modules`, `target`, `dist`,
  `*.exe`, `.l2arb/`).
- Component sources were vendored via `git archive` (clean trees, no nested
  `.git`). Only the **root** `.github/workflows` runs as CI; nested component
  workflows are inert history.

---

## 5. Build, test, run

**The whole thing (recommended):**
```bash
cd launcher
python3 -m l2arb doctor      # check toolchains + install state (+ next-step guidance)
python3 -m l2arb install     # build engine venv + dashboard + ingestion binary
python3 -m l2arb run         # paper mode, opens the dashboard at :8787
python3 -m l2arb setup       # guided live setup — paste one Arbitrum RPC URL
python3 -m l2arb setup --all-chains  # every chain: auto-detects env RPC creds, prompts
                                      # individually for the rest, auto-discovers pools
python3 -m l2arb run --live  # full stack (setup writes a live-ready .l2arb/config.toml)
```

**Per-component gates (must stay green when you touch that component):**
```bash
# engine
cd engine && make check
# ingestion
cd ingestion && cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace
# dashboard
cd dashboard && pnpm install && pnpm verify          # typecheck + test + build
# contracts
cd contracts && bash scripts/verify.sh               # fmt + build + test (needs forge)
# launcher
python3 -m unittest discover -s launcher/tests
```

**Cross-component integration smoke** (all four seams, on live data):
```bash
cd engine && uv run python ../scripts/e2e_smoke.py
```
Reads real Arbitrum pool state → engine `/detect` → WS envelope → dashboard
`ExternalProvider` → REST/UI controls → paper execute, and asserts the
`LiveExecutor` refuses to broadcast. Skips cleanly (exit 0) when the dashboard
isn't built or there's no outbound Arbitrum RPC, so it's safe offline.

**The `.exe`:** on Windows, double-click **`Build_L2ArbBot.bat`** (repo root) — the
easy-to-find entry point that wraps `scripts/build_windows_exe.ps1`. Also buildable
via `python scripts/build_exe.py` (any OS, for testing), directly via
`scripts/build_windows_exe.ps1`, or the `build-windows-exe` CI workflow, all
producing the real `L2ArbBot.exe`. See `docs/INSTALL.md`.

**Container path:** `docker compose up --build` (see `docker-compose.yml`).

---

## 6. Documentation discipline

Keep docs truthful in the **same commit** as the behaviour they describe. When
you change wiring, ports, or commands, update `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`docs/INSTALL.md`, and this file. Stale docs are treated as bugs. Each
component's own docs (`*/docs`, `*/CLAUDE.md`, `*/README.md`) remain the
authority for that component's internals.

---

## 7. Scope reminder

In scope: **detecting** 2-hop / triangular / bounded multi-hop / cross-chain
2-hop arbitrage from live on-chain data, surfacing it in a dashboard, and
**simulating** execution against audited flash-loan contracts. Out of scope
(never built here): signing/broadcasting live transactions from the loop,
deploying contracts from the loop, holding private keys, and MEV extraction.

---

## 8. Production debugging + enhancement pass (2026-07-29)

A full-stack audit (`claude/prod-debug-enhancements-x4gzp7`) found the baseline
already green across all five component gates (zero errors) but surfaced real
gaps between what was *documented* as live/enforced and what the code actually
did. Fixed, all covered by new tests, every gate green:

1. **Engine — data-integrity gating was computed but never enforced.**
   `Opportunity.verified` and pool freshness were both tracked but no code path
   ever rejected an unverified/stale pool before pricing it — contradicting
   `docs/DATA_INTEGRITY.md`'s own claim that this was already enforced.
   `detect/profit.py::evaluate()` and `detect/cross_chain.py::_build_opportunity()`
   now gate on both, first (before any AMM math). Freshness is opt-in at the
   pure-compute layer (`ProfitContext.now_ts`/`max_pool_age_seconds`, both
   `None` by default so the gate stays deterministic/testable) but always-on at
   the API boundary (`api/service.py::detect()` resolves a real `now_ts`
   default and the new `L2ARB__MAX_POOL_AGE_SECONDS` operator default, 120s).
2. **Engine — the entire `L2ARB__*` env-config surface was dead code.**
   `get_settings()` had zero call sites outside its own tests. `ChainConfig`/
   `DetectRequest` fields now use `Field(default_factory=lambda:
   get_settings().X)` so an *omitted* request field genuinely falls back to
   the operator's env default (an explicit request value still always wins —
   pydantic only invokes `default_factory` when the field is absent). Also
   wired `L2ARB__LOG_LEVEL` to real `structlog`/stdlib logging
   (`l2arb/logging.py`, new) and fixed the numba JIT cold-start SLO gap by
   calling `graph/tropical.py::warmup()` from the FastAPI lifespan.
3. **Ingestion — L1 data fee had no phantom-profit gate.** The aggregator held
   a chain back when `gas_price_wei == 0` (a fabricated-looking sentinel) but
   had no equivalent for a not-yet-read `l1_data_fee_wei` on the four OP-Stack
   chains. Extracted the combined check into `pipeline.rs::hold_back_reason()`
   (now unit-tested) — gated to OP-Stack only, since Arbitrum's L1 fee is
   legitimately always 0. Also bound `[observability].health_bind` (:9090) on
   its own listener — previously parsed and printed by `--check-config` but
   never actually bound; `/health`+`/metrics` were silently both living on
   `metrics_bind` (:9100) only.
4. **Dashboard — settings enforcement wasn't uniform across providers/paths.**
   `ExternalProvider` (the real production data source) ignored
   `networks`/`dexes`/`tokens`/`baseToken` entirely — only `SimulatedProvider`
   respected them. Moved that filtering into `ArbitrageEngine.qualifies()`
   (the one funnel every provider's candidates pass through) and made
   `maxConcurrentTrades`/`cooldownMs`/`maxDailyLossUsd` (previously enforced
   only inside the `autoExecute()` loop) also gate a manual/API
   `executeOpportunity()` call via a new `riskLimitBlock()` check.
5. **Dashboard — every setting reverted to schema defaults on restart.**
   `settings/persistence.ts` (new) loads/saves `backend/.data/settings.json`
   (git-ignored); `server.ts` wires load-on-boot + save-on-change.
   `executionMode` is the deliberate exception — it always re-seeds from the
   operator's current `EXECUTION_MODE` rather than resuming a possibly-stale
   persisted value (invariant 3 above stays boot-time authoritative).
6. **Launcher — a startup crash or Ctrl-C could orphan already-started
   services.** `run.py`'s sequential engine→ingestion→dashboard startup had no
   `try`/`except` — a mid-sequence failure (or `KeyboardInterrupt`, a
   `BaseException`, while `wait_http` was polling) propagated straight out,
   leaving already-started processes running and holding their ports for the
   next `l2arb run`. Now wrapped so every started service is stopped before
   the error propagates.
7. **Contracts — `DexType.GENERIC` had no router allowlist.** Unlike the typed
   dex types (fixed selector, output recipient hardcoded to `address(this)`),
   `GENERIC` handed `step.router` fully attacker-controlled calldata — a
   compromised `EXECUTOR_ROLE` key could route a step to e.g.
   `transfer(attacker, hugeAmount)` on any token the contract holds, entirely
   bypassing the route-asset and profit checks (which only look at the
   declared first/last leg and the overall balance delta). Added
   `allowedGenericRouters` (deny-all default) + `setGenericRouterAllowed`,
   gated `GUARDIAN_ROLE` (not `EXECUTOR_ROLE` — the hot bot key must not be
   able to expand what `GENERIC` can call). See `contracts/README.md` §Security
   model and `contracts/docs/INTEGRATION.md`.

**Net effect on "is every setting live-adjustable and operational?"**: yes,
with the boot-time exceptions that are deliberate safety invariants
(`EXECUTION_MODE`, `L2ARB__*` env vars — process-level, not hot-reloaded
without a restart, same as before). Full research notes:
`docs/notes-prod-debug-enhancements.md`.

---

## 9. Granular stress-test + enhancement audit (2026-07-31)

A second, deeper full-stack audit (`claude/stress-test-audit-pm9eya`) re-verified
the baseline **green across every runnable gate** (engine 440, ingestion 185,
dashboard 76+28, contracts-Hardhat 37, launcher 76 — the Foundry suite is BLOCKED
here, `forge` not installed, recorded not faked) and then hunted, with five parallel
per-component auditors, for defects between documented and actual behaviour. Every
finding was independently re-verified before any change. **18 confirmed defects
fixed, each with a regression test where testable; all gates re-run green.** The
lower-severity remainder is recorded (not faked) as a triaged, reproducible backlog
in `docs/notes-stress-test-audit.md`.

The fixes, most-severe first:

1. **Dashboard — the entire live data path was dark (CRITICAL).**
   `ArbitrageEngine.qualifies()` filtered each route leg's `dex` against the
   venue-key chip set, but `ExternalProvider` (the real `DATA_SOURCE=external` feed
   that `l2arb run --live` uses) labels a leg with its *pool address* — engine data
   carries no venue brand. So **every** external opportunity was silently dropped and
   the live dashboard was permanently empty. No test composed `engineMap → qualifies()`,
   which is why it hid. The venue chip now applies only to legs labelled with a venue
   key we model (`KNOWN_VENUE_KEYS`); an unlabelled pool-address leg keeps its
   network/token/profit filters but is not venue-filtered (fabricating a venue would
   break invariant 2.1). Also: USD-magnitude gates apply only to USD-denominated opps
   (`numeraireIsUsd !== false`); `maxDailyLossUsd=0` no longer halts at t0 (strict `<`).
2. **Contracts — held-token drain via a discontinuous route (fund-safety).**
   `_runRoute`'s "spend up to the live balance" cap, combined with no step-to-step
   continuity check, let a compromised `EXECUTOR` name an intermediate `tokenIn` the
   previous hop didn't produce but the contract holds (a parked/airdropped token),
   vacuuming it into the trade and paying it out as "profit" — with plain typed dexes,
   bypassing the GENERIC allowlist. `executeArbitrage` now requires
   `steps[i].tokenIn == steps[i-1].tokenOut` (new `RouteNotContiguous`).
3. **Engine — a degenerate StableSwap crashed the whole `/detect` batch (HIGH).**
   `-math.log(0.0)` on an imbalanced-but-valid StableSwap pool's 0.0 marginal rate
   raised `ValueError` with no downstream `try/except`, losing every opportunity in
   the batch. Such an edge is now skipped like an untradable one. Plus: a cross-chain
   phantom-profit guard when a numeraire/asset has different decimals across chains,
   and the cross-chain verified/freshness gate now runs *before* pricing (matching the
   `DATA_INTEGRITY.md` guarantee).
4. **Launcher — the Windows live path was broken + process-lifecycle leaks (HIGH).**
   `setup` wrote the pool path into a TOML *basic* string, so a Windows backslash path
   became invalid escapes and the whole `config.toml` failed to parse (flagship `.exe`,
   masked by a POSIX-only test) — now TOML-escaped. Plus: SIGKILL-path zombie reaping,
   a SIGTERM handler (so `kill`/`docker stop` doesn't orphan children), restored
   startup-grace on restart, a closed browser-open/monitor-construction orphan window,
   and a Popen-failure fd leak.
5. **Ingestion — L1-fee under-cost + a permanently-dead WS accept loop (HIGH/MED).**
   The L1 data fee was sampled with an *empty* tx (zero calldata → phantom profit on
   OP-Stack); it now samples a real recorded tx (arb-sized/config-driven sample is a
   recorded follow-up). The WS accept loop no longer dies permanently on a transient
   `accept()` error, and the reconnect backoff resets after a stable connection.

**Recorded (not fixed) — see `docs/notes-stress-test-audit.md`:** the standout is an
ingestion bug where `retain_valid` validates the engine response against the
*incremental delta* only, dropping opportunities that route through unchanged pools
(feed near-silent in steady state) — CONFIRMED by trace, but the fix touches a
safety-critical validation path whose end-to-end correctness needs the real `l2arb`
engine, which is BLOCKED in this environment; recorded with a precise recommended fix
rather than shipped speculatively. Also recorded: cross-chain-executor GENERIC
hardening, in-range V3/V4 liquidity events, and assorted lower-severity items.

## 10. Dashboard contract deploy/monitor + MetaMask + live stress test (2026-08-01)

Branch `claude/flash-contract-stress-test-l5smfa`. Added an operator-facing
**Contracts** capability to the dashboard — compile, deploy, monitor, and a
read-only live readiness sweep — plus first-class MetaMask SDK wallet operation,
all built to the binding safety model (root §2/§3, contracts golden rule 5):
**the backend never holds a key and never broadcasts; every on-chain write is
signed by the operator's MetaMask.** Every gate re-run green (contracts 40
offline, dashboard `pnpm verify` = typecheck + 102 backend + 34 frontend +
build). Foundry Solidity suite remains BLOCKED (`forge` not installed — recorded,
not faked).

What was built, and the safety reasoning:

1. **Compile / deploy buttons + status monitor (`dashboard/backend/src/contracts/*`,
   `frontend/src/components/ContractsPanel.tsx`).** New `/api/contracts/*` surface:
   `status` (per-chain *verify-provider → compile → deploy → ready* monitor),
   `compile` (server-side Hardhat — no chain, no key), `artifact/:name` (serves the
   compiled ABI+bytecode), `deploy-params/:network` (constructor args from the
   **verified** `config/addresses.js` only — an unverified chain 400s, never
   inventing an address per golden rule 7), `deployment` (records a deploy),
   `readiness` (the sweep). The **deploy** flow is the sanctioned pattern: the
   browser fetches the artifact and **`useDeployContract` signs it in MetaMask**;
   the backend only *records the resulting public address* into
   `contracts/deployments/<net>.json` **and** the master `.env`
   (`FLASH_LOAN_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS_<NET>`, filling the singular probe var/chain only
   if empty). The `.env` writer (`envFile.ts`) refuses any non-address key, so a
   secret can never be written.

2. **Full MetaMask SDK integration (`frontend/src/config/wagmi.ts`,
   `WalletButton.tsx`).** Added the first-class wagmi `metaMask()` connector
   (wraps `@metamask/sdk`; extension + mobile deep-link/QR) alongside the existing
   injected/Coinbase fallbacks; the connect button prefers it. MetaMask *is* the
   "human-authorised signer" the whole product is architected around — this is the
   piece that makes gated live deploy/execute possible without a server-side key.

3. **Profit → connected wallet.** The atomic executor **already** forwards 100% of
   profit to `profitReceiver` (or `msg.sender` when unset) and retains nothing
   (`FlashLoanArbitrage._settle`); added the missing-coverage regression test for
   the `profitReceiver = 0` → tx-signer fallback (the "profit straight to your
   connected wallet by default" path) and surfaced the guarantee in the UI. So #5
   was a *wiring/verification* task, not a contract rewrite.

4. **Live stress test — honestly shaped.** A real profitable arb can't be forced on
   mainnet (profit-or-revert ⇒ a blind fire just reverts), and unattended
   broadcast is the forbidden line. So the "stress test across every chain +
   cross-chain" is delivered as: deploy the real contracts per chain via MetaMask,
   then a **strictly read-only** readiness sweep (`getCode` + `aavePremiumBps()`
   staticCall) over every recorded deployment — exposed both in the UI ("Run
   readiness sweep") and headless (`scripts/contract_stress_test.mjs`, raw
   JSON-RPC, offline-safe/exit-0 like `e2e_smoke.py`). Real execution stays a
   human-signed MetaMask action.

**Deliberately NOT built (crosses binding invariants):** a backend-held hot key,
any server-side broadcast, or an unattended auto-fire loop. **Honest limitation
recorded:** the dashboard's engine-fed opportunities carry detection data (pool
addresses + token symbols), *not* an executable `ArbParams` route (router
addresses, DexType, calldata) — see `engineMap.ts` — so a one-click *live execute*
of an arbitrary opportunity is not constructible without fabricating route data
(invariant 1). Live execution therefore requires the real route params; the panel
delivers deploy + read-only simulation and leaves execution to the human-signed
path. Full notes: `docs/notes-flash-contract-stress-test.md`.

## 11. Ingestion production audit + stress test (2026-08-03)

A 4th full audit pass (`claude/ingestion-audit-stress-test-wgbo9y`), focused on
the **ingestion** component per the task brief, plus a full-stack live-readiness
verification. Two environment blockers every prior session recorded as BLOCKED
are **lifted here**: outbound Arbitrum RPC works, and the real `l2arb` engine
stands up locally (`cd engine && uv sync --all-extras && uv run uvicorn
l2arb.api.http:app --port 8080`). That unblocked `scripts/e2e_smoke.py` to run
to completion against real chain state for the first time, and closed out
`crates/engine-client/tests/live_engine.rs` — a test written for exactly this
scenario that had never been able to run before. `forge`/Foundry remains not
installed (BLOCKED, not faked); Hardhat's 40-test suite still covers the
contracts.

Baseline reconfirmed green (engine 442/99.87% cov, ingestion 186, contracts
Hardhat 40, dashboard 102+34, launcher 80 — 884 tests). Audit method: 4 parallel
subagents split the ingestion codebase by crate group, 1 audited every
interactive dashboard control against its backend wiring, 1 re-verified the
contracts profit-to-wallet path and that detected opportunities are real. Every
finding independently re-verified by direct code reading (and a regression test,
for anything fixed) before being recorded. Full ledger:
`docs/notes-ingestion-audit-stress-test.md`.

**7 confirmed defects fixed**, most-severe first:

1. **Ingestion, HIGH — the `retain_valid` root cause, corrected.** Three prior
   sessions recorded a "feed goes near-silent in steady state" issue and
   attributed it to `retain_valid`'s validation logic. With the real engine now
   reachable, the true cause is different and worse: `pipeline.rs` truncated
   `req.pools` to the incremental delta, but the real `l2arb` engine builds a
   **fresh, fully stateless graph on every `/detect` call** — an omitted pool
   isn't "safely already known" to it, it's absent from the search entirely.
   Proven with a live A/B test (partial pool set → 0 opportunities; full set →
   2, correct profit). This made the ordinary case — one leg's pool moves, its
   cycle partner doesn't, same tick — undetectable after a session's first
   tick. Fixed: ingestion now always sends each chain's full current verified
   snapshot; `incremental` stays a wire signal only.
2. **Ingestion, CRITICAL — V3 Mint/Burn and V4 ModifyLiquidity were never
   dispatched.** Fully decoded, fully applied to the mirror, directly
   unit-tested at the decode/mirror layer — but the live log dispatcher
   (`apply_log`) had no branch for either, so both were silently dropped on the
   live path while `re_stamp` kept re-labelling the resulting stale liquidity
   `verified:true` every tick. Reconcile can't catch it (checks each pool at
   its own already-stale block). Fixed: both branches wired; `apply_log`
   refactored to a free function so it's directly unit-testable; 5 new tests.
3. **Dashboard, HIGH (same severity class as #1) — found live, not by static
   analysis.** Running the real `e2e_smoke.py` end-to-end surfaced a genuine
   engine-detected opportunity that never reached `/api/opportunities`.
   `qualifies()` required an exact `opp.tokenIn === s.baseToken` match; the
   engine closes a cycle in whichever hub token actually produced the edge
   (every shipped chain's `hubs` list WETH *and* USDC, several also USDT), not
   the one the operator picked as "Base asset" — so any real opportunity in a
   non-default numeraire was silently dropped, exactly the §9 "entire live
   data path was dark" bug's shape recurring on a different field. A
   *pre-existing test* had encoded the bug as correct behavior; corrected, not
   deleted. Verified live twice: manual repro, then a clean 12/12
   `e2e_smoke.py` run.
4. **Ingestion, HIGH — config validation didn't require any chain be
   enabled.** A config with every `[[chains]]` block present but all disabled
   passed `--check-config` and ran forever idling, `/health` reporting healthy
   throughout. Fixed.
5. Two more small fixes: a purpose-built engine-integration test had a
   hardcoded blockstamp that had drifted ~385 days stale relative to a later
   session's freshness gate — fixed to use real wall-clock time, now passes
   against the real engine for the first time. `e2e_smoke.py`'s own final
   safety-check gave a false-positive "SAFETY REGRESSION" alarm due to a test
   sequencing bug (an unrelated cooldown gate firing before `LiveExecutor` got
   a chance to run) — fixed; confirmed `LiveExecutor` itself was never actually
   broken.
6. **Dashboard, HIGH — the header Play/Pause button showed a stale "Running"
   state indefinitely after a pause** (the one code path that skipped the stats
   push to connected clients). Plus two MEDIUM UX-honesty fixes: executing an
   expired opportunity failed completely silently (now alerts, like every
   other rejection path), and MetaMask connect/network-switch rejections were
   silently swallowed (now surfaced, matching the pattern the Contracts panel
   already used correctly). Plus two LOW one-line fixes (a missing input clamp
   matching the backend schema; `resetSettings()` had no error handling at
   all).

**14 further findings recorded** (not fixed this session) with precise
reproduction steps and recommended fixes — most notably: no liveness/staleness
watchdog on a chain's WS subscription (CRITICAL — `verified:true` can mean
"frozen," live-reproduced, but the correct fix restructures the
supervisor/health startup order across several files, which isn't something to
rush against a safety-relevant path); HTTP endpoint failover never actually
triggers for a genuinely dead endpoint, its primary use case (HIGH,
empirically proven); the L1 data-fee sample is undersized 20–63× for a real
multi-hop route's calldata (HIGH, precisely quantified). Two findings from the
initial audit passes (a reseed/generation-bump race; an `IncrementalTracker`
cache-key collision risk) turned out to be **substantially defused as a side
effect of fix #1** — noted explicitly in the notes file rather than left at
their original severity.

**Contracts + opportunity-detection re-verification: both hold, nothing to
fix.** Re-checked against current HEAD rather than trusting the changelog:
profit routing to the connected wallet, route-contiguity, and the GENERIC
router allowlist are all still enforced and test-covered; an exhaustive grep of
the whole `dashboard/` tree found zero signer construction and zero
autonomous-broadcast path anywhere — deployment remains the only
browser-signed chain-write in the product. The honest limitation from §10 is
unchanged: detected opportunities still can't be turned into a one-click live
execution without fabricating route data the engine doesn't emit.

**Net result:** ingestion 186→194 tests, dashboard 102+34→107+37 tests, both
gates green; `e2e_smoke.py` and `live_engine.rs`'s real-engine test both pass
for the first time in this repo's history.

## 12. Cross-chain flash-loan arbitrage gap audit (2026-08-04)

A 5th audit pass (`claude/cross-chain-flash-loan-gaps-v2fki8`), this time scoped
specifically to **cross-chain** execution: what's actually blocking a successful
cross-chain arbitrage trade, as opposed to the same-chain path prior sessions
already hardened. Framing, confirmed before auditing anything, not assumed:
cross-chain arbitrage in this repo is — correctly, by design —
**non-atomic**. `contracts/contracts/crosschain/CrossChainArbitrageExecutor.sol`
implements the honest, real-world model: two separate transactions
(`executeSourceLeg` on chain A, a bridge, `executeDestinationLeg` on chain B),
never a fictitious "atomic cross-chain flash loan" (a transaction cannot span
two chains). This audit measured the system against that honest premise, not
against a stricter atomicity guarantee that was never claimed.

Five parallel read-only audits (contracts, engine, ingestion, dashboard, and a
repo-wide sweep for the spec-mandated off-chain orchestrator) confirmed the
on-chain leg-execution primitive is real and individually tested, but was
entirely unreachable end-to-end: no real bridge adapter existed (only a test
mock), nothing anywhere called `executeSourceLeg`/`executeDestinationLeg`
outside the contract's own tests, and the engine's profit/risk math hadn't yet
accounted for the two-transaction reality. Full findings, severity, and the
fix/record reasoning for every item: `docs/notes-cross-chain-flash-loan-gaps.md`.
Baseline reconfirmed green across every runnable gate before any change
(contracts 48 prior to this session's additions, engine 460, ingestion full
workspace, dashboard 171 — Foundry remains BLOCKED, `forge` still not
installed in this environment, consistent with every prior session).

**13 confirmed defects fixed**, each with a regression test, all gates re-run
green after every commit (not just at the end):

1. **Contracts — a bridge-adapter drain vector, and no sibling-address
   guardrail.** `executeSourceLeg` `forceApprove`d a caller-supplied
   `bridgeAdapter` for the *entire* held balance with no allowlist — the exact
   same shape of risk as the `DexType.GENERIC` router issue §8 item 7 already
   fixed on `FlashLoanArbitrage.sol`, just never applied here. Added
   `allowedBridgeAdapters` (deny-by-default, `GUARDIAN_ROLE`-gated), mirroring
   that fix precisely. Also added a `siblingExecutor` registry
   (chainId → known-good address) so a registered chain enforces
   `dstRecipient` matches it — additive/backward-compatible, chains with no
   registered sibling behave exactly as before.
2. **Engine — the cross-chain profit gate had zero allowance for price
   movement during settlement.** Both legs were priced off the same instant
   snapshot with no discount for the real wait (`settle_seconds`, often 600s+
   — 5x past the engine's own 120s same-chain freshness bar), and the
   cross-chain risk penalty was a flat constant regardless of that wait, so a
   30-second fast-bridge opportunity and a 60-minute canonical-bridge
   opportunity got an identical confidence score. Added a settle-time-scaled
   `price_drift_cost` (opt-in/`None` at the pure-compute layer, a real
   operator default via `L2ARB__CROSS_CHAIN_PRICE_DRIFT_BPS_PER_MINUTE` at the
   API boundary — same threading pattern as the existing freshness gate) and
   split `MevModel`'s cross-chain penalty into a base risk plus a per-minute
   component, calibrated to reproduce the old flat value exactly at the 600s
   reference wait this codebase's own fixtures already used, so it's a
   refinement, not a re-guess. Also closed a numeraire-fungibility gap: only
   the bridged *asset* was checked via `registry.are_fungible()`; the
   numeraire got a strictly weaker decimals-only check 20 lines away — now
   checks both.
3. **Ingestion — cross-chain could silently resolve to fully inert.**
   `config.example.toml` ships `[cross_chain] enabled = true` with placeholder
   addresses; `--check-config` printed the raw unfiltered config (looking
   fully wired) without ever running the real parse/filter path, and the live
   process would silently send `cross_chain: None` forever with zero log
   signal — the same "healthy-looking total outage" shape §9/§11 already rated
   CRITICAL/HIGH elsewhere in this repo. Now warns when configured-enabled
   cross-chain detection ends up with zero usable assets, and `--check-config`
   reports genuine post-filter counts. Also fixed `validate_response`'s
   `verified_pools` set being keyed on bare address with no `chain_id` (several
   configured L2s are OP-Stack siblings sharing identical predeploy addresses,
   so a pool verified on chain A could rubber-stamp an unverified same-address
   leg on chain B — closed with an adversarial regression test proving the
   collision is actually dropped), and `filter_cross_chain` not enforcing its
   own documented "must have a real bridge" invariant.
4. **Dashboard — cross-chain opportunities couldn't be represented, were
   executed dishonestly, and could bypass network filters.**
   `ArbitrageOpportunity` had exactly one chain field, and the mapper always
   resolved it to the source chain — the destination chain was discarded
   unconditionally, every time. Added `isCrossChain`/`destChainId`/
   `destNetwork`/`settleSeconds`, resolved defensively (never guessed when
   ambiguous). Built on that: `PaperExecutor` had been modelling every revert
   as "atomic, lose only gas," which is false for a contract whose own NatSpec
   says capital sits in flight between two separate transactions — a
   cross-chain opportunity is now never run through the atomic model, coming
   back `status:"skipped"` with an honest reason instead (and excluded from
   executed/reverted stats, so a modelling refusal can't misread as a real
   failed trade). `qualifies()` now also checks the destination network, not
   just the source — previously an operator who explicitly disabled a chain
   had no way to keep a cross-chain trade routed through it from qualifying.
   Finally, the Contracts panel's deploy flow — hardcoded to
   `FlashLoanArbitrage` despite `CrossChainArbitrageExecutor` already being
   scaffolded in the backend — now supports deploying and recording both
   contracts through the same MetaMask-signed flow.

**15 further findings recorded, not fixed this session** — see the notes file
for full per-item reasoning, but the throughline is the same one root
`CLAUDE.md` §2 already states as a binding invariant: a real bridge-protocol
integration, and the off-chain orchestrator the spec (`contracts/docs/specs/
10-cross-chain.md`) assigns exposure caps, hedging, inventory accounting, and
deadline/refund handling to, are Phase-9-scoped and explicitly gated on
human-set risk parameters ("NEEDS HUMAN" in the spec's own words). Building
any of that speculatively this session — guessing at exposure-cap dollar
values or a hedging strategy — would be exactly the kind of thing to stop and
record rather than fake. Most notable recorded items: no real `IBridgeAdapter`
implementation exists anywhere (only a test mock — this is the single biggest
remaining blocker to any live cross-chain trade); no on-chain or off-chain
exposure cap; no deadline/refund path if a bridge stalls after the source leg
fires (recovery is manual, privileged `rescueTokens`, not a protocol
guarantee); the engine's emitted `Opportunity` still carries zero fields an
executor would need to construct a real route (same category as the
already-accepted same-chain limitation from §10, but total rather than
partial for cross-chain); and no unified kill switch pauses both contracts
together (a MetaMask-signed "Pause/Unpause" panel mirroring the existing
deploy-signing pattern is the recommended shape for a future session).

**Net result:** contracts 48 tests (+12), engine 460 tests (full suite,
99.87% coverage), ingestion full workspace green (fmt+clippy clean), dashboard
171 tests (126 backend + 45 frontend) + both builds — all four gates verified
green by this session directly (not just trusted from a sub-agent's report)
before each component's commit. The on-chain execution primitive, the
detection math, the data model, and the execution/filtering wiring are now
individually correct and honest about the non-atomic reality; what remains
before a live cross-chain trade is possible is the real bridge integration and
the off-chain orchestrator — both correctly out of scope for a same-session
fix, both precisely specified in `docs/notes-cross-chain-flash-loan-gaps.md`
for whichever session picks them up.

## 13. Production audit + first live flash-loan execution (2026-08-09)

A 6th audit pass (`claude/audit-flash-loan-execute-qkyth2`). Task: *"Run a granular
production grade audit and fill any gaps and try to live execute one flash loan
and deposit it into the environments metamask wallet address."* Full ledger:
`docs/notes-audit-flash-loan-execute.md`.

**Environment change worth knowing about.** This is the first session whose
container carries **real operator credentials**: `EXECUTOR_PRIVATE_KEY` (deriving
to `0x50A71dF7DfC5850e8434C7c8A564366F4980183b`), a matching `PROFIT_RECEIVER`
env var, and working Polygon/Arbitrum/Base RPC. Balances are small (~0.0035 ETH
on Base, ~0.09 POL on Polygon, dust on Arbitrum, 0 on Optimism). `ARB_CONTRACT_
ADDRESS` is also set and holds real bytecode on Polygon, but it belongs to a
**different project** in this workspace — it is not a `FlashLoanArbitrage`
deployment and must not be treated as one. This repo still has **zero deployed
contracts** on any chain.

**The live-execution half, and where the line was drawn.** A mainnet broadcast
was *not* performed, for three independent reasons, any one of which is
sufficient: (1) §2 invariant 3, §10, and `contracts/CLAUDE.md` golden rule 5 all
forbid the loop broadcasting or deploying — §2 says to stop and record rather
than implement it; (2) nothing is deployed to call, and deploying is itself a
forbidden write; (3) profit-or-revert plus the still-open "engine emits no
executable route" limitation (§10, §12-E2) means a blind fire just reverts and
burns gas. The user was asked explicitly which of three paths to take
(fork-execute / deploy-only / full broadcast) and did not answer, so the
non-destructive path was taken and the decision left open.

What *was* delivered is the strongest proof available without crossing that
line — and it is genuinely new capability, not a restatement:

1. **`contracts/scripts/live_flash_loan_fork.js` (new).** Executes **one real
   flash loan** against live chain state: forks the chain at its current head,
   deploys this repo's real executor, borrows from the **real Aave V3 pool at
   the real live premium**, routes through **real Uniswap V3 + real
   QuickSwap/SushiSwap pools**, repays, and deposits the profit to a named
   wallet. Verified on both chains — Polygon: **1621.94 WMATIC profit on a
   3442.05 WMATIC loan** (live 5 bps premium); Arbitrum: **0.0489 WETH on a
   0.0396 WETH loan** — each asserting three things independently (receiver
   balance delta, the `ArbitrageExecuted` log's `profit` *and* `profitReceiver`
   args, and zero residual in the executor). The destination address was
   corroborated from two unrelated sources (the env var and the key derivation).
   **Safety:** `assertForkOnly` refuses every real network in
   `hardhat.config.js`, so the script cannot be repointed at mainnet by changing
   a flag; it builds no signer over the key (address derivation only). That
   guard is unit-tested directly, and both failure paths were verified to exit
   non-zero. Like the fork suites it manufactures its dislocation, and says so
   in its own output — it proves the pipeline works and pays the right wallet,
   **not** that this profit exists on mainnet.

2. **Fork suites unblocked and given CI coverage for the first time.** Both
   Hardhat mainnet-fork suites ran here against live state — the first time
   either has executed in this repo's history (Arbitrum 4 passing, Polygon 5
   passing, cross-chain dual-fork 1 passing). Then the gap that kept them dark:
   nothing ran them. `npm test` pinned four offline files, `test:fork*` were
   hand-invoked, and CI's only *fork* hook pointed at the **Foundry** suite,
   gated on an `ARBITRUM_RPC_URL` secret that has never been configured — so
   that step has never actually run either. So the repo's only end-to-end
   execution proof had zero automated coverage behind a CI step that looked
   like it provided some. All three Hardhat suites plus the live-execution
   script are now wired into CI, each gated on the RPC secret it needs.

   **Correction to the earlier framing in this file's history:** Foundry is
   unavailable in these *sandboxed sessions* (`forge` not installed —
   reconfirmed again here, so the local Solidity suite stays BLOCKED, not
   faked), but it installs and runs fine **in CI** via `foundry-toolchain@v1`:
   the run on this PR executed 16 Foundry tests green. Only the fork-gated
   Foundry step is dark, and only for want of a secret. Prior sessions' "the
   Foundry suite has never executed" should be read as "never executed *in a
   dev sandbox*" — it is not true of CI.

**3 confirmed defects fixed**, each with a regression test:

1. **Contracts, MEDIUM — profit was paid to the right wallet but logged to
   `0x0`.** `_settle` resolved `profitReceiver == address(0)` to the tx signer
   when transferring, then emitted the **raw** `p.profitReceiver` in
   `ArbitrageExecuted`. That default path is exactly the "profit straight to
   your connected wallet" behaviour §10 item 3 advertises, and this engine keeps
   its PnL history in logs rather than storage (per the event's own docstring),
   with the receiver field `indexed` — so a downstream indexer filtering
   "arbitrage that paid me" by topic matched **nothing** for the most commonly
   used path. The pre-existing regression test asserted balances only and never
   inspected the event, which is why it hid — the same "no test composed the two
   layers" shape as §11 item 3. The new test was run against the pre-fix
   contract and confirmed to fail before being accepted.
2. **Contracts, MEDIUM — asymmetric-fee pairs were systematically mis-sized.**
   `quoteOptimalTwoHopV2` takes a fee for *each* pool and documents both as
   such, but forwarded only `feeBpsBuy` into `optimalV2Amount`, whose own single
   `feeBps` is documented as "applied on both hops" — while the profit estimate
   returned alongside already charged each pool its own fee, so the two halves
   of the quote disagreed. Any asymmetric pairing (a 0.30% V2 pool against a
   0.05% V3-style pool — the common real case) was sized for a pair that does
   not exist. Generalised the closed form to keep both multipliers; it collapses
   to the shipped formula exactly when the fees match, so it extends the
   existing math rather than replacing it. Validated numerically against a
   brute-forced optimum *before* writing Solidity: exact parity at equal fees,
   and **+0.01% to +3.06%** more profit across asymmetric pairs, with the gain
   largest where the spread is tightest.
3. **CI, MEDIUM** — the fork-coverage gap described above.

**1 finding recorded, deliberately not "fixed":** no operator-facing surface in
`dashboard/`, `engine/` or `launcher/` sets `profitReceiver` (grep confirms the
identifier lives only in `contracts/` and its own tests/examples). This looks
like a wiring gap on the task's exact ask, but adding a setting there would be
**dead config** — the dashboard has no live-execution path at all by design, and
dead env surface is precisely the defect class §8 item 2 already had to remove.
The code that actually builds `ArbParams` — `contracts/integration/examples/
bot.js:59` and `bot.py:52` — already sets `profitReceiver` to the signer's own
address, correctly. Recorded so a future session doesn't "fix" it into dead code.

**Re-verified, no defect:** callback caller/initiator validation, the
`_CB_ARMED` latch, route contiguity, the GENERIC router allowlist, pre-balance
snapshotting, and the `_runRoute` live-balance cap all still hold at HEAD. The
Yul hot paths (`_swapUniswapV2`, `_swapUniswapV3Single`, `balanceOf`,
`_getReserves`, `aavePremiumBps`) were re-derived by hand against their
documented calldata layouts — offsets and selector sourcing correct.

**Net result:** contracts **48 → 66** offline tests plus 10 live-fork tests now
running and CI-wired; engine 460 / ingestion 204 / dashboard 126+45 / launcher
80 all re-run green and untouched. **What still blocks a real mainnet flash
loan is unchanged and is not a code bug in the executor:** no executable route
data from the engine (§10, §12-E2), no deployment on any chain, and a thin gas
buffer. The executor itself is proven operational against live infrastructure
on two chains and pays the wallet it is told to.

---

## 14. First real mainnet deployment (2026-08-10)

Follow-up to §13, same session. After PR #25 merged, the operator was asked once more whether
to proceed with a real broadcast — the concern having already been raised twice (an unanswered
`AskUserQuestion`, then an explicit closing ask). They replied **"Go ahead."** A concern raised
and then reaffirmed is the user's decision, so the deployment was performed.

**This is a deliberate, human-authorised override of §2 invariant 3 and `contracts/CLAUDE.md`
golden rule 5** ("never deploy or send a live transaction from the loop"). It is recorded here
rather than quietly done. The invariants themselves are unchanged and still bind future
sessions: a future agent must not read this as standing permission to broadcast. Each such
action needs its own explicit human authorisation.

**`FlashLoanArbitrage` is live on Base at `0x17fB2Da9D6b6f95962Ad21f39aAE43f40Caaf602`**
(admin/guardian/executor = `0x50A71dF7DfC5850e8434C7c8A564366F4980183b`, aavePool
`0xA238Dd80…d1c5`, balancerVault `0xBA122222…F2C8`). Actual cost **0.0000188 ETH (~$0.07)**.
Base was the only viable chain: Arbitrum holds 0.000002 ETH, and Polygon's 0.09 POL is roughly
one deploy at 30 gwei with no headroom. `CrossChainArbitrageExecutor` was skipped
(`SKIP_CROSSCHAIN=1`) — inert without a sibling on a second chain, and there is no gas for one.

**What was NOT done:** `executeArbitrage` was not broadcast. With no engine-emitted route data
and profit-or-revert semantics, a blind fire is a guaranteed revert and pure gas burn. That was
stated to the operator and was not part of what they approved.

Two new scripts, both of which earn their place:

1. **`contracts/scripts/preflight_deploy.js`** — read-only. Refuses to proceed if either
   flash-loan provider address has no code on the target chain, then reports a real
   `eth_estimateGas` against live state and whether the deployer can afford it with headroom.
   Run this before `deploy.js` on any real network; it issues no writes.
2. **`contracts/scripts/verify_deployment_executes.js`** — forks the chain at its current head so
   the *deployed* contract exists in fork state, then drives **that address's real on-chain
   bytecode** (not a fresh compile) through a full arbitrage. This is the difference between "the
   code we compiled works" and "the thing actually sitting at that address works." Result on Base:
   borrowed 50 WETH from the real Aave V3 pool at the real 5 bps premium, **profit 0.1033 WETH**
   to the operator wallet, gas 495,341, logged profit == balance delta, executor residual 0.

**Verified independently on-chain**, not trusting the deploy script's own output: 13,660 bytes of
bytecode; `aavePremiumBps()` staticCall returns **5**, read live from the real Aave pool (proving
both the ABI and the Aave wiring); `paused()` false; `hasRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE, deployer)` true; and
the repo's own `scripts/contract_stress_test.mjs` readiness sweep passes (1 chain, 0 failures).

**Two gotchas worth keeping** (both found empirically here, both cost real debugging time):

- **`BAL#528`** — Balancer's Base vault holds only ~27.9 WETH, so a 50 WETH flash loan reverts
  `INSUFFICIENT_FLASH_LOAN_BALANCE`. Aave's Base reserve holds ~18,000 WETH. Check provider
  liquidity before sizing, per chain — it differs wildly between the two providers.
- **Hardfork history on a pinned fork** — an `eth_call` at *exactly* the fork block is treated as
  historical execution and fails with "No known hardfork … in chain with id 8453" despite
  `hardhat.config.js` declaring `8453: { hardforkHistory: { cancun: 0 } }`. Mine one block past the
  fork point (`hardhat_mine`) so execution lands on a locally-mined block. Separately, the public
  `mainnet.base.org` is load-balanced and can serve a stale head, so an unpinned fork may land
  *before* a just-sent deployment — pin `FORK_BLOCK`.

**Net effect on "can this bot make a real trade?"** One blocker cleared, two standing. There is now
a real, live, role-configured executor on Base, proven to run. Still missing: the engine emits
detection data, not constructible `ArbParams` (§10, §12-E2), so nothing in this repo can produce a
real profitable route today; and the gas buffer is ~0.0034 ETH. The 0.1033 WETH above came from a
manufactured dislocation on a fork — **not** realised profit. The operator's real balance is
unchanged apart from the deploy gas.

---

## 15. Cross-chain arbitrage stress test + live execution proof (2026-08-10)

A 7th audit pass (`claude/cross-chain-arbitrage-stress-test-psxjbh`), the 2nd focused specifically on
cross-chain (after §12). Task: *"Run a comprehensive stress test and report any gaps or problems we
have that need to be filled and try to execute one cross chain arbitrage flash loan smart contract
successfully."* Baseline reconfirmed green across every gate **independently, by this session directly
— before and after every fix**, not just trusted from a sub-agent's report (contracts 66, engine 460,
ingestion 204, dashboard 171, launcher 80 — 884 tests). Method: four parallel fresh-eyes audits
(engine, ingestion, dashboard, launcher), each briefed with the exact findings of every prior session
so they hunt for *new* gaps instead of rediscovering old ones; contracts handled directly by this
session, since the cross-chain execution decision is safety-critical. Full ledger, including the
corrected build design for the new execution script and a sanity check on the reported profit number:
`docs/notes-cross-chain-arbitrage-stress-test.md`.

**Live environment re-verified fresh, not assumed from notes.** The Base `FlashLoanArbitrage`
deployment from §14 (`0x17fB2Da9D6b6f95962Ad21f39aAE43f40Caaf602`) is confirmed still live
(`aavePremiumBps()`→5, `paused()`→false). Balances unchanged in kind from §13/§14: Base ~0.00345 ETH,
Polygon ~0.091 POL, Arbitrum dust (0.0000023 ETH), Optimism 0. `contracts/deployments/` is absent in
this fresh container (git-ignored by design — expected, not a defect). Foundry got further than any
prior session — `foundryup` downloaded all binaries at 100% for the first time — but failed attestation
verification; declined `--force` (skips SHA verification, labelled insecure by the tool itself) given
this container holds a real operator private key, so `forge` remains BLOCKED locally, recorded with
this more precise detail rather than faked.

**14 confirmed defects fixed**, each with a regression test, every gate independently re-run green
both before and after (884 → 954 tests):

1. **Engine, HIGH (data-integrity) — phantom profit via an unvalidated bridge fee.** `BridgeQuote`'s
   `fee_bps`/`fixed_fee`/`settle_seconds` had zero validation, unlike every sibling domain object. A
   negative `fee_bps` made `net_after()` return *more* than the bridged amount — manufactured,
   `verified:true`-reported profit from a config typo, reachable since the ingestion-side field has no
   lower-bound check either. Fixed with `__post_init__` validation (mirroring `PoolState`/`Blockstamp`)
   plus a Hypothesis property test (`net_after(amount) <= amount` for any constructible quote) and a
   schema-level `Field(ge=0)` so a malformed HTTP request 422s at the boundary.
2. **Engine, HIGH — cross-chain dedup collision across chains.** `ranking.py`'s dedup key built a
   `frozenset` of bare pool-address strings with no chain tag — the same shape as the already-fixed
   ingestion bug (§12/I2), never checked on the engine side. Fixed: key now pairs `(chain_id,
   pool_address)` per leg.
3. **Engine, MEDIUM — cross-chain `min_profit_bps` ignored the destination chain's stricter
   threshold.** Only the buy-chain's per-chain override was ever applied. Fixed: now
   `max(buy_ctx.min_profit_bps, sell_ctx.min_profit_bps)`, strictly more conservative than either side
   alone.
4. **Ingestion, CRITICAL (core property closed) — no liveness watchdog on a chain's WS `heads`
   subscription.** The single most significant open finding carried across *two* prior audit cycles
   (§11 recorded it CRITICAL and live-reproduced; §12 didn't re-attempt it). An upstream node's WS
   could go quiet without ever erroring, so nothing in the old `select!` loop could ever notice —
   `verified:true` could go stale indefinitely with zero signal, a direct violation of the `verified`
   honesty invariant (§2 item 7). Especially costly for cross-chain trades, which are exposed to two
   chains' staleness risk over a multi-minute non-atomic settle window. Fixed: a new `stale_after()`
   threshold (30s floor, 20×block-time above it) plus a watchdog branch in the `select!` loop that
   returns `Err` to reuse the existing, already-tested supervisor reconnect path. Deliberately *not*
   covered: `/health` and the `CHAINS_LIVE` gauge still don't reflect a stalled-then-reconnecting chain
   in real time — needs restructuring `pipeline.rs::run()`'s startup order, recorded as a follow-up
   rather than rushed on a safety-relevant path.
5. **Ingestion, HIGH — HTTP endpoint failover never actually triggered for a genuinely dead
   endpoint,** its primary documented use case (recorded in §11, not fixed until now). Every RPC read
   method collapsed any transport error straight to a generic call-error variant, so a raw connection
   failure was never recognised as failover-worthy. Fixed with a `classify()` helper using `alloy`'s
   own `is_transport_error()`; proven with an empirical test that connects to a closed local port and
   confirms the real production path now fails over.
6. **Dashboard — MetaMask-signed Pause/Unpause kill-switch panel**, closing §12's O2 recommendation
   now that a real contract is actually deployed on Base (§14) to make it concrete rather than
   speculative. Same sanctioned pattern as deploy: the backend only serves the read-only compiled ABI
   and re-probes `paused()` after the tx confirms; it never signs. A live-state `paused: boolean |
   null` is now part of the readiness sweep, never guessed `false` when unreadable.
7. **Dashboard, MEDIUM (misleading-honesty class) — cross-chain opportunities were indistinguishable
   from same-chain ones in the opportunities table**, and the Execute button's tooltip claimed a
   simulated fill or live broadcast that a cross-chain row never actually performs (it's always
   recorded `"skipped"`, per §12's D2). Fixed: destination chain + settle time now shown (or an honest
   "unresolved" when ambiguous — never guessed), tooltip corrected.
8. **Dashboard, LOW — `NETWORK_COLORS` missing `unichain`/`ink`**, undermining fix #7 (a cross-chain
   row touching either chain rendered indistinguishable gray dots). Fixed.
9. **Launcher, HIGH — the same TOML-injection class §9/§10 already fixed for `pool_registry` was never
   applied to `ws_url`/`http_url` in `l2arb setup`** — the two fields an operator actually hand-pastes
   from an RPC dashboard. Verified exploitable through the real CLI before fixing.
10. **Launcher, HIGH — `config_is_live_ready()`'s placeholder-marker list missed the shipped example's
    Unichain V4 fields**, so a user who filled every other placeholder was told the config was
    live-ready and `run --live` would launch against a fake address. Fixed with a principled check (any
    `0x`-prefixed token containing a non-hex character can only be a placeholder), defending future
    placeholder shapes too.
11. **Launcher, MEDIUM — `payload.ensure_payload()` not safe under a concurrent double-launch of the
    `.exe`.** Fixed (already caught by the crash net, but a needless scary traceback for a non-failure).
12. **Launcher, LOW — `proc.run()` never explicitly closed its subprocess pipe.** Fixed.

**Contracts — no defects found; HEAD re-verified clean.** `allowedBridgeAdapters`, `siblingExecutor`,
route contiguity, the `GENERIC` allowlist, and profit-receiver-to-event-log consistency all re-checked
directly against source, all still correct. This session's contracts work was entirely about **proving
execution**, not fixing bugs.

**Cross-chain execution — what was run.** The existing dual-fork proof
(`test/fork/CrossChainDualFork.test.js`) re-confirmed passing live against real Polygon+Arbitrum state.
Beyond that, a new script, `contracts/scripts/live_cross_chain_fork.js`, extends the §13
`live_flash_loan_fork.js` precedent to the two-leg cross-chain model: the executor spends real,
organically-funded USDC.e inventory to buy WETH on a real, momentarily-and-honestly-dislocated Polygon
QuickSwap pool, bridges it (simulated — no real `IBridgeAdapter` exists, see §12/C1), sells it at
Arbitrum's real, untouched Uniswap V3 price, and sweeps the result to the real operator wallet via the
guardian-gated rescue path. Result: bought 2.185768 WETH with 3,790.54 USDC.e on the dislocated pool,
sold it for 4,074.86 USDC.e at Arbitrum's real price — **net +284.32 USDC.e delivered to
`0x50A71dF7DfC5850e8434C7c8A564366F4980183b`**. Sanity-checked before accepting: the script's own
honest counterfactual (pre-dump reserves, same input, no external price feed) shows the undislocated
round trip would have netted roughly *−45 USDC.e* — confirming the reported profit is genuinely
attributable to the disclosed manufactured dislocation, not a measurement artifact. Wired into CI
alongside the same-chain script, behind the same RPC secrets.

**Why a REAL (broadcast) cross-chain execution was not attempted — not a judgment call, a hard
technical fact.** `MockBridgeAdapter`, the only `IBridgeAdapter` implementation anywhere in this repo,
"pulls tokens, emits an event, delivers nothing cross-chain" by design. A real broadcast through it
would pull real funds on the source chain with **no delivery mechanism on the other side** — not a
revert-and-lose-gas outcome like the same-chain case (§13), a **permanent, irreversible loss**. That
alone rules out any real attempt regardless of gas or deployment state; compounding it,
`CrossChainArbitrageExecutor` is deployed on zero chains, Arbitrum/Optimism gas remains
dust-to-nothing, and no off-chain orchestrator exists (§12/C3, correctly Phase-9-gated). The new
fork-based proof above is the strongest safe alternative; a real bridge integration is real,
substantial, security-sensitive scope that deserves its own explicit conversation with the operator,
not a speculative same-session build.

**Net result:** 14 confirmed defects fixed (4 engine, 2 ingestion — including closing the core safety
property of this repo's longest-standing recorded CRITICAL finding, 4 dashboard, 4 launcher); one
further ingestion gap (degenerate-zero pool seeding across V2/V3/V4, broader than previously scoped)
recorded rather than rushed. All five gates re-run green throughout (884 → 954 tests). The cross-chain
dual-fork proof now has a stronger, wallet-targeted sibling proving genuine, honestly-disclosed profit
capture end-to-end on two live chains — the first time this repo has demonstrated that. What remains
before a *real* mainnet cross-chain trade is possible is unchanged in kind from §12 but sharper in its
most important particular: the blocker isn't just "the orchestrator is Phase 9" — it's that attempting
one today, even with a perfect route, would strand real funds in a bridge adapter that delivers
nothing. That single fact should anchor whichever future session picks up the real bridge integration.

## 16. Compile/deploy GUI hardening, cross-chain token expansion, pool registries (2026-08-10)

A parallel 7th session (`claude/arbitrage-gui-compile-deploy-0cvfjn`), merged after §15. Task,
verbatim: make the dashboard's
compile/deploy buttons fully functional and error-free for both contracts; add a GUI wallet-private-
key prompt for "pre-authorized" automatic signing so trade profits deposit to the connected
MetaMask wallet, not the contract; ensure all contracts are Yul-optimized; make a real `.exe` launch
produce a `config.toml` with complete pool data; expand cross-chain arbitrage from 2 tokens to
15-20. Full research notes and every sourced address: `docs/notes-arbitrage-gui-compile-deploy.md`.

**Declined, not built: the private-key GUI prompt.** A field for users to paste a raw private key
so the app can sign transactions without per-transaction confirmation is hot-key custody in a web
backend — precisely the architecture §2 invariant 3, §10, §12, and §13 have deliberately built
*against*, six times over. Per §2's own instruction ("stop, do not implement it, and record the
concern"), this was declined rather than built. The underlying goal was already true without it:
`profitReceiver` defaults to the transaction signer, so profit already lands in the connected
wallet automatically inside the same atomic transaction MetaMask signs — no key custody needed, and
none was added anywhere in `dashboard/` this session (grep-verified clean, as in every prior audit).

**Dashboard — compile/deploy were already architecturally correct; two real bugs fixed.** Both
contracts already had working, independent, MetaMask-signed compile+deploy flows (§10, §12 item 4).
Fixed: (1) `ContractsPanel.tsx`'s `busy.deploying` was a single shared `string | null` — deploying
on one network while another was still mid-transaction silently cleared the first row's spinner and
re-enabled its button, a real double-deploy risk; now a `Set<string>` keyed per (network, contract)
pair. (2) The real wagmi-wired deploy/compile handlers (`onDeploy`/`onDeployCrossChain`/`onCompile`)
had zero test coverage — only the pure-props view was tested; 5 new tests added (happy paths,
wallet-rejection messaging, and a concurrency regression test proving two networks can deploy
simultaneously without clobbering each other). Also fixed in passing: `dashboard/backend/test/
api.test.ts`'s execution-health test assumed a clean ambient environment (`configured: false`) but
this sandbox carries real operator RPC env vars from prior live-execution sessions (§13/§14) — the
test now explicitly isolates `rpcUrls`/`executorAddress`/`executionProbeChain` instead of trusting
ambient state, so it passes identically in any environment rather than depending on what happens to
be (or not be) set.

**Yul — investigated, measured, correctly *not* shipped.** The one real gap (`CrossChainArbitrage
Executor.sol` had zero Yul) was traced to `_walkRoute`'s per-hop `SwapStep memory step = steps[i]` —
a genuine calldata-to-memory struct decode, unlike `FlashLoanArbitrage._runRoute`'s identical-
looking line (a free pointer copy, since its route is already memory-resident from `abi.decode`).
Concretely implemented: refactored `DexRouter.execute` from one `SwapStep memory` parameter to
twelve scalar parameters so each caller passes only the fields it already has. Measured via `git
stash` A/B on a real 2-hop `executeDestinationLeg` call, run twice each way: **161,240 gas before,
162,209 after — a reproducible +969 gas regression**, not a win (marshalling twelve stack arguments
across the internal-call boundary cost more than the avoided struct-decode saved, for the common
empty-`data` case). Reverted per the project's own rule (`contracts/docs/specs/07-gas-and-yul.md`:
"optimize against a benchmark, never on vibes"). The attempt and its measured result are recorded in
`CrossChainArbitrageExecutor.sol`'s own NatSpec so a future session doesn't re-derive and re-attempt
the same losing change. Net: no Yul was added or removed anywhere; the existing 10 hand-optimised
functions in `DexRouter.sol`/`FlashLoanArbitrage.sol` are untouched.

**Cross-chain tokens: 2 (placeholder, actually 0 usable) → 14 (real, individually verified).** The
shipped `[cross_chain]` config's every address was a literal placeholder string (`"0xWETH_ARB"`,
not hex) — `filter_cross_chain` was silently pruning it to **zero** usable assets, worse than the
"2 tokens" framing suggested. Replaced with 14 symbols (WETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, WBTC, LINK, UNI,
AAVE, wstETH, cbETH, rETH, CRV, FRAX, LDO) across the 5 supported chains where each is genuinely
deployed (2-5 chains per symbol depending on real availability — Unichain and Ink are honestly
thinner ecosystems, not padded to look uniform), every address individually sourced and cross-
verified (official docs, Circle's/Chainlink's/Lido's own deployment pages, the Uniswap official
token list, block explorers) with confidence notes, catching and rejecting along the way: an active
scam token squatting the "OP" symbol on Arbitrum, an aToken mistaken for the underlying AAVE, and
several search-summary-hallucinated addresses caught by cross-checking a primary source before use.
ARB and OP are deliberately excluded (no genuine canonical presence outside their home chain); Ink's
USDT-equivalent (USDT0) is deliberately *not* merged into the plain "USDT" asset (a different
contract, would misrepresent two tokens as fungible). `--check-config` confirms **14/14 assets
usable** post-filter (up from 0). Landed at 14, short of the requested 15-20 floor, because that is
where rigorously-verifiable data honestly ran out for this specific 5-chain set — one candidate
(SNX) was checked and rejected mid-session for conflicting addresses rather than guessed; widening
further is a safe, well-scoped follow-up (repeat the same sourcing discipline for more candidates),
not a design gap. `contracts/config/addresses.js` mirrors the same verified tokens (plus real
Uniswap V3 factory + native V2-DEX-factory addresses per chain) for deploy-params reuse.

**Pool registries: 1 of 5 chains (2 pools) → 5 of 5 chains (23 pools, all on-chain-verified).**
Real Uniswap V3 factory addresses (individually verified, Base/Unichain each have their *own*
deployment — not the cross-chain-default address) were queried live via `getPool()` directly against
Arbitrum/Base/Optimism/Unichain/Ink RPC (this container has real, reachable RPC for all five,
inherited from §13) for WETH/USDC/USDT/DAI pairs; every returned pool's `token0`/`token1`/
`liquidity()` was read back on-chain before being written to a registry, and zero-liquidity results
were dropped. New `config/pools/{base,optimism,unichain,ink}.example.toml`; `arbitrum.example.toml`
grew from 2 to 4 real pools. A new permanent test (`l2i-registry::schema::
every_shipped_example_pool_registry_parses_and_is_canonically_ordered`) parses all 5 files under the
real schema and asserts canonical `token0 < token1` ordering on every entry — the same rule the
on-chain startup gate enforces, checked here at zero cost. Solidly-style DEXes (Aerodrome, Velodrome)
are deliberately excluded — out of scope per `docs/ENGINE_CONTRACT.md` §1 (not a plain
constant-product/concentrated-liquidity shape the engine can price).

**Launcher: pool materialisation was Arbitrum-only from every code path — now all 5 chains.**
`ensure_config_toml()` (the default `install`/`ingestion_cmd` path, not just the quick-start wizard)
previously copied `config.example.toml` verbatim, leaving every chain's `pool_registry` pointing at
a relative path (`config/pools/<chain>.toml`) that no automated path had ever created except
Arbitrum's — the exact "4 of 5 chains get zero pools" gap this session's task named. New
`setup.materialize_pool_registries()` copies every shipped `<chain>.example.toml` into the writable
state dir; `ensure_config_toml()` now rewrites each `pool_registry` line to the materialised
absolute path (through the same Windows-backslash-safe `_toml_str` escaping already fixed once for
the quick-start path, §9 item 4 — regression-tested again here for this new call site). The
single-endpoint Arbitrum quick-start wizard itself is unchanged by design (still the deliberately
minimal "paste one RPC URL" hero path); it now simply inherits 4 real pools instead of 2, since it
copies the same, now-larger, `arbitrum.example.toml`.

**Not done, deliberately:** per-chain `hubs`/`numeraires`/`weth`/`native_price_pools` fields in
`config.example.toml`'s `[[chains]]` blocks still carry their original placeholders (e.g.
`hubs = ["0xWETH", "0xUSDC", "0xUSDT"]`) — this session's research covers most of what filling them
in for real would need (verified WETH/USDC/USDT per chain, verified WETH/USDC pools per chain), but
wiring it in is a distinct, mechanical piece of work that would have meant rushing it against this
session's own time budget; recorded here rather than done partially. A full dynamic on-chain
pool-discovery engine (querying factories automatically at setup-time, beyond this session's
one-off discovery script) remains the ingestion README's own long-standing aspirational follow-up,
now with a proven, working query pattern (this session's throwaway `getPool()` script) to build it
from, not just a TODO.

**Gates, all re-run green after every change (not just at the end):** dashboard `pnpm verify`
(typecheck + 126 backend + 50 frontend, +5 from this session + build); contracts (compile + 66
offline Hardhat tests, unchanged — the Yul attempt was verified then reverted before it could touch
this count); ingestion (`cargo fmt --check` + `clippy -D warnings` + full workspace test suite, +1
new permanent test); launcher (87 tests, +7 from this session); engine untouched, reconfirmed green.

**Post-merge reconciliation with §15.** This branch and `claude/cross-chain-arbitrage-stress-test-
psxjbh` (§15) were developed in parallel from the same base and both touched `ContractsPanel.tsx`,
`launcher/l2arb/config.py`/`setup.py`, and this file — merged by hand, not auto-resolved. The one
substantive overlap: §15 added a `busy.pausing: string | null` field for its new Pause/Unpause
panel, the exact single-shared-string shape this section's own `busy.deploying` fix (above) had
just closed for deploys — so `pausing` was folded into the same `Set<string>`-based, per-
(network,contract) tracking as part of reconciling the two, rather than merging it in with the bug
still present. `launcher/l2arb/config.py`'s two changes (this section's pool-registry rewriting,
§15's stricter non-hex-placeholder detection) touch different functions and merged with no logical
overlap. All five gates re-verified green **after** the merge, not just before it: engine 469
(untouched by either session, reconfirmed), contracts 73 (66 + §15's 7 new cross-chain-fork-script
tests), ingestion (`fmt` + `clippy -D warnings` + full workspace suite, all green), dashboard
(typecheck + 67 frontend + backend + build, all green), launcher 97 (this section's 87 + §15's ~10).

## 17. Ingestion engine endpoint/pool loading + multi-chain guided setup (2026-08-10)

An 8th pass (`claude/ingestion-engine-endpoints-rx9h18`), task: *"debug and fix the ingestion
engine and ensure it is loading up websocket and RPC endpoints, or at least [prompt] the user to
individually add all ingestion routes and endpoints and also pools if not automatically
generated."* Tier-A reconfirmed green before any change — the gap was operational, not a broken
build. Full detail: `docs/notes-ingestion-engine-endpoints.md`.

**The real bug.** `Config::validate()` checked that `ws_url`/`http_url` were non-empty for every
enabled chain but never checked *what* they were — so a config still carrying the shipped
`config.example.toml`'s literal template text (`wss://YOUR_ARBITRUM_WS`, ...) passed
`--check-config` clean. At runtime, `AlloyProvider::connect`'s HTTP side is lazy (no round-trip
at construction) and a failing WS candidate just logs a warning and falls back to no subscription
— so the failure only ever surfaced as an opaque connect/DNS error on the first real RPC call,
then looped forever with a generic "chain ingestor exited — reconnecting" that never explained
why. The same "looks valid, isn't ready" shape §9/§11/§12 already found and fixed elsewhere in
this repo, just never previously found for endpoints. Fixed: `validate()` now rejects, for every
*enabled* chain, an endpoint containing the shipped placeholder marker or not shaped like an
absolute `ws(s)://`/`http(s)://` URL — enforced at the Rust layer itself, not just the Python
launcher's pre-existing heuristic. Regression-tested against the *actual* shipped example file
(config crate 12 → 16 tests).

**Pools were the other half of "not loading."** Only Arbitrum had a real, committed pool
registry; `config/pools/README.md` had said since inception "a discovery script can seed them,"
with none existing. Built `ingestion/scripts/discover_pools.py` (stdlib-only Python): fingerprints
a candidate Uniswap V3 factory on-chain before trusting it (never by reputation/memory alone),
then calls `getPool()` directly per fee tier — one cheap read, not a millions-of-blocks log crawl
— and independently re-verifies every result. The two extra ABI selectors it needs are pinned
against alloy's real, tested Keccak256 in a new `crates/registry/src/abi.rs` assertion rather than
trusted from memory. Run live against this session's real RPC credentials: found and verified 4
real WETH/USDC pools (every standard fee tier) each on **Base** and **Optimism** — now committed
as `config/pools/{base,optimism}.example.toml`, closing 2 of the 4 missing-registry gaps this repo
has carried since inception. (Unichain — native V4, a different discovery mechanism entirely — and
Ink — no confidently-known factory anywhere in this repo — are honestly left for the fallback
below rather than guessed at.) A real bug found building it: some RPC gateways 403 the stdlib
default `Python-urllib` User-Agent as bot traffic — fixed by sending a normal one, confirmed live.
16 offline tests, including an end-to-end replay of the real, already-committed Arbitrum pool as a
fixture.

**The literal fallback the task asked for: `l2arb setup --all-chains`.** Generalizes the existing
Arbitrum-only quick-start (kept unchanged, still the default) to every target chain: auto-detects
an RPC endpoint already in the environment (`RPC_URL_<CHAIN>`, `<CHAIN>_RPC_URL`, the engine's
existing `L2ARB__CHAINS__<CHAIN>__{HTTP,WSS}` convention) before ever prompting; anything not
found is asked for individually, skippable. Pools: live discovery first, then a shipped example,
then — never a guess — the chain is written **disabled with the endpoint preserved** and the exact
next command spelled out in the file itself, never silently dropped. 29 new launcher tests (90 →
119), all offline/deterministic.

**Live-proven, this session's real environment, not just unit-tested.** Built the release binary
and ran the real CLI against this container's actual credentials: all 5 chains auto-detected from
the environment with zero prompts; Base + Optimism got live-discovered pools; Arbitrum fell back
to its shipped example (rate-limited at the time — the honest fallback path working as designed,
not a failure); Unichain/Ink correctly landed disabled. The real built `l2-ingest --check-config`
passed cleanly against the real generated config. Running the real binary live: `/health`/`/metrics`
responded, and **the validation gate + mirror-seeding completed successfully for Base and Optimism
against real, live on-chain state** — genuine, live proof the HTTP RPC + pool-loading path works
end-to-end.

**What didn't get proven live — an environment limit, not a code defect.** Every WS connection
attempt (three unrelated providers — dRPC, QuikNode, Alchemy) failed identically with a TLS
`UnknownIssuer` error. This sandbox's own agent-proxy documentation (`/root/.ccr/README.md`) lists
**WebSocket upgrades** explicitly under "not supported through the proxy — report, do not work
around." Plain HTTPS to the same three providers worked fine in the same run (proof above); only
the WS upgrade handshake specifically isn't supported by this sandbox's egress proxy. The
ingestion engine's own behavior was correct throughout: it attempted every WS endpoint, logged a
specific error, and retried through the existing tested backoff/supervisor path without crashing —
exactly the designed degrade path. On a real deployment with direct internet access these are the
same publicly-trusted-CA endpoints already proven to work for HTTP in this run, so WS would connect
the same way. Recorded rather than worked around, per this sandbox's own instructions.

**Net result:** ingestion config crate 12→16 tests, registry crate +3, full workspace 221 tests —
Tier-A green throughout, re-run after every change. 8 real, independently-verified, on-chain pools
newly shipped (Base + Optimism). Launcher 90→119 tests. Every one of the 5 target chains now has a
working, tested path to a real config: automatic wherever this session could verify real data
on-chain, and an explicit, individually-prompted, never-fabricating fallback everywhere it
couldn't — with a config that's still template text now failing loudly at `--check-config` time
instead of degrading into a silent, unexplained reconnect loop.

**Post-merge reconciliation with §16.** This branch and `claude/arbitrage-gui-compile-deploy-
0cvfjn` (§16) were developed in parallel from the same base and both independently built pool
auto-discovery/curation for the same chains — real add/add conflicts on `config/pools/
{base,optimism}.example.toml`, resolved by hand, not auto-merged. Every overlapping pool address
between the two sessions' independently-derived data matched exactly (case-insensitive) — strong
cross-validation that both approaches (this session's live `getPool()` fingerprint-and-verify tool,
§16's live `eth_call`-verified manual research) produced genuinely correct on-chain data, not just
internally-consistent data. Resolution merged rather than picked a side: `base.example.toml` kept
this session's 4th fee-tier pool §16's research had missed; `optimism.example.toml` was regenerated
via this session's discovery script with §16's wider WETH/USDT/DAI/USDC token set (every one of
§16's claimed addresses re-verified live before accepting), yielding 22 independently-verified pools
(up from either session's partial set alone) — `arbitrum.example.toml` and the new `unichain.example.toml`/
`ink.example.toml` are §16's unmodified, separately-verified work.

§16's Unichain/Ink factory research (real, chain-specific Uniswap V3 deployments — not the
cross-chain-default factory address) was itself independently re-verified live during this
reconciliation (both factories re-fingerprinted, every claimed pool re-derived via fresh
`getPool()` calls, all matching exactly) — which corrected this session's own original, overly
conservative framing that Unichain/Ink couldn't be auto-discovered (§16's research disproved that
directly). `discover_pools.py`'s `CHAIN_CANDIDATES` and `setup.py`'s `_CHAIN_TEMPLATE` are extended
accordingly (3 → 5 chains), so `l2arb setup --all-chains` can now fully auto-assemble every one of
the 5 target chains, not just 3, wherever an RPC endpoint is available.

`launcher/l2arb/setup.py`/`config.py` merged with no logical conflict: §16's `materialize_pool_
registries()`/`ensure_config_toml()` rewrite (the default `install` path, all 5 chains' pool data)
and this session's `run_setup_all_chains()`/`materialize_chain_pools()` (the `--all-chains` guided
wizard, live discovery + per-chain endpoint prompting) touch different call paths entirely and are
complementary, not competing: the former guarantees every fresh install ships real pool data even
in paper mode; the latter is what actually wires up live RPC endpoints per chain. A new launcher
test proves the extension concretely: given an endpoint and their real shipped example, Unichain
and Ink now render *enabled* through `--all-chains`, not disabled-with-endpoint-preserved.

All gates independently re-verified green **after** the merge, by this session directly: ingestion
(`fmt` + `clippy -D warnings` + full workspace suite, 222 tests — up from either session's own count
alone), `discover_pools.py`'s own offline suite (16 tests, unaffected by the new candidates — pure
functions, chain-agnostic), launcher (127 tests — 119 from this session + §16's own additions, +1
new for the Unichain/Ink extension above). Dashboard/contracts/engine were untouched by this merge
resolution (no conflicts on those trees) and were already independently verified green by §16
before landing.

## 18. Guided health-check setup + the UTF-8 config crash (2026-08-11)

Branch `claude/ingestion-config-utf8-evs83j`. Reported from a real Windows `.exe` run: the
health HUD showed `ingestion ● failed`, 5 restarts, with `config error: reading config
C:\Users\joels\AppData\Local\L2ArbBot\.l2arb\config.toml: stream did not contain valid UTF-8`
looping forever while engine and dashboard stayed green. Task: fix that, and build an
in-depth guided setup that health-checks **every** environment variable, secret, RPC
endpoint, WebSocket URL and API key on every launch, explains and prompts for whatever is
missing until the check reads 100%, and stores the answers in a new local SQLite database.

**The crash — root cause, proven, not guessed.** Every launcher file read/write used
`Path.read_text()`/`write_text()` with no `encoding=`, so it took Python's default text
encoding — which on Windows is the legacy ANSI codepage (cp1252 on a typical Western
install), not UTF-8. The config `l2arb setup` generates opens with

    # L2 Arbitrage Bot — Arbitrum quick-start config (generated by `l2arb setup`).

whose em dash (U+2014) encodes under cp1252 to the **single byte 0x97**. A lone 0x97 is not
valid UTF-8, and the Rust binary reads its config with `std::fs::read_to_string`, which is
UTF-8-only — so `l2-ingest` died on every start, the supervisor restarted it, and the HUD
reported exactly what the operator saw. Reproduced directly (`"…—…".encode("cp1252")` →
`can't decode byte 0x97`). Two things made it invisible until a user hit it: POSIX defaults
to UTF-8, so every test and every prior session passed; and the *shipped example* config
round-trips byte-identically under cp1252 (its non-ASCII bytes are all cp1252-defined), so
only the **generated** configs — the `setup` paths — were corrupt. `proc.py` had already
pinned UTF-8 for subprocess pipes in an earlier session; file I/O was simply missed.

Fixed with a new `launcher/l2arb/textio.py` that every launcher read/write now goes through:
writes UTF-8, no BOM, LF newlines on every platform; reads `utf-8-sig` so a BOM added by
Notepad is stripped (a BOM is valid UTF-8 but *not* valid TOML — it would have moved the
failure to an opaque parse error rather than removing it). Plus `repair_encoding()`, called
from `ensure_config_toml()`: an install already broken by this bug **self-heals on the next
launch** (legacy-decode → rewrite as UTF-8, original kept as `.bak`) instead of expecting the
user to diagnose a codepage fault from a restart loop and delete a file under `AppData`.
14 regression tests, including one that plants the exact byte sequence the old writer
produced and asserts the repair recovers the original text.

**The guided setup.** Five new modules, ~1,100 lines, 116 new tests:

1. **`credentials.py`** — the SQLite store, created on first use at `.l2arb/credentials.db`
   (owner-only 0600 where the platform supports it; `.l2arb/` is already git-ignored). Holds
   credentials plus a `health_runs` history. Trust model is stated explicitly rather than
   implied: values are plaintext, *the same as the `.env` file this supersedes* — the only
   available alternatives were a passphrase retyped every launch (defeating "ask once") or a
   machine-derived key stored beside the database (security theatre). Secrets are never
   printed: `mask_url()` hides the whole final path segment, since on every mainstream
   provider that segment *is* the API key.
2. **`requirements.py`** — the catalog: one record per value, carrying not just a validator
   but the full user-facing explanation (what it is / why the app needs it / where to get it,
   with real dashboard URLs and click-paths / what a correct answer looks like). Three tiers,
   and the score is computed over **blocking** items only, so 100% is a real claim rather
   than a participation trophy. Guarded by meta-tests: every requirement must explain itself,
   every worked example must pass its own validator, and every per-chain public fallback must
   belong to the chain it is offered for (all five sourced from this repo's own
   `contracts/hardhat.config.js`, not from memory).
3. **`healthcheck.py`** — resolution (real env → database → default, matching the precedence
   §3 already documents, with the source of every value reported so a stale exported variable
   is visible rather than mysterious), format validation, and **live proving**: a real
   `eth_chainId` call checked against the chain the endpoint was entered for. That catches
   both a dead endpoint and pasting Base's URL into Arbitrum's box — a mistake no amount of
   format validation can see, and one whose only other symptom is a silently empty feed.
4. **`wizard.py`** — the walk-through: report, then per missing value the full explanation and
   a drawn input box. Skippable at every box, bounded retries so a prompt that can never be
   satisfied degrades to a skip instead of spinning, hidden entry for typed API keys but
   *not* for pasted URLs (where hiding makes a typo invisible for no real secrecy gain), and
   a non-interactive path that prints what to set instead of hanging.
5. Wiring: `l2arb health` (new), `setup` now defaults to the guided walk (`--quick` and
   `--all-chains` unchanged), and **`auto` — the double-clicked `.exe` — runs the check on
   every launch**. The gate never blocks: it degrades to safe paper mode, so an incomplete
   config explains itself instead of failing in a restart loop, which is the whole shape of
   the bug above. Stored values are injected into the child services' environment
   (`healthcheck.env_overrides`), so a collected value actually reaches the process that
   reads it rather than becoming dead config surface (§8 item 2's defect class).

**Deliberately not prompted for, and why.** *Token/DEX/pool addresses*: they are on-chain
facts, not credentials — already shipped verified and re-proven by the ingestion startup
gate. The check materialises them automatically (all five chains verified present, 4–12 pools
each) rather than asking; hand-typing a pool address is precisely how fabricated market data
enters a bot (§2 invariant 1). *A wallet private key*: none is collected and **none is needed
to reach 100%** — the detection stack holds no keys and signs nothing (§2 invariants 2/3), so
this is not a gap in the score. The only wallet value collected is the **public** address
profit is paid to, and that box actively warns the user never to paste a seed phrase — the
same request §16 declined, declined again, and here the honest alternative is wired instead.

**Verified on the real artifact, not just unit-tested.** PyInstaller was installed and
`python scripts/build_exe.py --clean` run to completion, then the frozen binary driven through
a real pty exactly as a user would: chain selection → one pasted RPC URL → WebSocket URL
derived automatically → API key box skipped → wallet address entered → **100.0% (3/3)** → a
`config.toml` written that is **valid UTF-8** and parses cleanly under `tomllib` with the real
Arbitrum chain id, hubs, native-price pool, and the materialised pool registry path. Two real
bugs were found by doing this rather than assuming: SQLite connections are thread-bound, so
value resolution had to move out of the probe thread pool (only the network calls are
parallel now); and the input box's top border was computed 2 columns short, which is only
visible when you actually render it. One packaging hazard was also closed on the way:
`scripts/l2arbbot.spec` hand-listed every `l2arb.*` module, which goes stale silently the
moment a module is added — the frozen exe would be missing code the dev checkout has, and it
would only show up on Windows at runtime. Now `collect_submodules("l2arb")`, plus an explicit
`sqlite3` hidden import (the launcher's one non-pure-Python stdlib dependency).

**Net result:** launcher 127 → 257 tests, all green, re-run after every change. The reported
crash is fixed at the root, cannot recur anywhere in the launcher (all text I/O goes through
one module), and heals itself on already-broken installs. `l2arb health` gives an honest
0–100% score over what the app genuinely cannot run without; `l2arb setup` walks an operator
from nothing to a live-ready config in one paste, and every answer persists in the new SQLite
database. Other components were untouched, so their gates are unaffected.

## 19. The UTF-8 crash that survived its own fix, + health-check honesty (2026-08-11)

Branch `claude/l2arbbot-health-check-qgahn9`. Reported from a real `.exe` run: the guided
health check from §18 rendered correctly, scored **66.7% (6/9)**, and then the launcher died
on the way to starting the stack:

```
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x97 in position 19: invalid start byte
  l2arb/cli.py:194 _effective_live → l2arb/config.py:98 config_is_live_ready
  → l2arb/textio.py:49 read_text
```

Four confirmed defects, each reproduced first and each covered by a regression test that was
**verified to fail against the pre-fix source** before being accepted (19 new tests, launcher
257 → 276). Every one of them is a second-order failure of a fix a previous session shipped —
the fix was right, its reach was not.

1. **The §18 UTF-8 fix was unreachable by the users who needed it (the reported crash).**
   §18 fixed the *writer* and added `repair_encoding()` so a broken install self-heals. Two
   things then stopped that from ever happening. First, `textio.read_text()` stayed **strict**,
   so a config already corrupted by the old writer — the only population the repair exists for —
   crashed the launcher *on the way to being healed*. Second, `cmd_auto` called
   `ensure_config_toml()` (where the repair lives) **only inside the `if not ready.dashboard`
   install branch**, which is exactly backwards: a config written by an older launcher can only
   exist on an install that already exists, so the repair ran only where there was nothing to
   repair. Fixed on both counts — `read_text` now recovers legacy bytes via the same decode
   `repair_encoding` uses (a read and a repair can never disagree), and `ensure_config_toml`
   runs unconditionally as the first statement of `cmd_auto`. `OSError` still propagates:
   tolerating a *decodable* file must not blur into tolerating a missing one.

2. **An upgraded `.exe` keeps the first install's component sources forever** — the cause of
   the report's `base: missing` / `optimism: missing`, and of `arbitrum: 2 pool(s)` against a
   shipped registry that has had 4 since §16. `payload.ensure_payload` skips any component whose
   directory already exists, so the unpacked tree is written once, on the very first launch, and
   never refreshed. Every pool lookup then read that stale tree and honestly concluded the chain
   ships no registry — while the running executable carried it the whole time. New
   `setup.shipped_pool_dir()` prefers the bundle inside the running `.exe`
   (`sys._MEIPASS/payload/ingestion/config/pools`) and falls back to the source tree, so a dev
   checkout is unchanged. Verified the payload really does carry them (`build_exe.py`'s ignore
   list excludes build artifacts, not `config/`) rather than assuming.

3. **A rate-limited RPC endpoint was scored as a broken one.** The report's Base endpoint
   answered `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` and the check called it *unreachable*. A 429 is proof
   the endpoint is real, routable and serving RPC — it answered. Counting it as a failure was
   wrong three times over: it told the operator a working URL was dead, it put 100% out of reach
   for anyone on a free tier through no fault of their configuration, and since the launcher
   degrades to paper mode below 100% (§18) it silently downgraded the whole run over a momentary
   throttle. Now: one short retry (honouring `Retry-After`, capped at 3s so a provider cannot
   stall startup), then a distinct `RATE_LIMITED` status that **counts as satisfied** and says
   plainly what could not be proven — `endpoint is live; chain id not confirmed this run` —
   rather than implying a verification that did not happen. Providers that signal throttling in a
   JSON-RPC error body with HTTP 200 are matched too; guard tests prove a genuine RPC error and
   an auth failure are still failures, so the net did not over-broaden.

**Verified against the real artifacts, not just unit tests.** PyInstaller was installed and
`scripts/build_exe.py` run to completion, then the frozen binary driven through the reported
scenario — a workspace whose four component dirs already exist (so `ensure_payload` skips them)
carrying only a 2-pool Arbitrum registry, plus a `config.toml` written in cp1252. The real
`.exe` reported `arbitrum: 4 / base: 4 / optimism: 22 pool(s)` from its own bundle, and on the
already-installed launch path repaired the config in place with the original kept as `.bak`.

The `l2-ingest` binary was also built (`cargo build --release`) to close the loop on the
component that produced the original error, and it reproduces the field failure exactly:

```
$ l2-ingest --check-config --config <cp1252 config>
config error: reading config …: stream did not contain valid UTF-8     # exit 1
$ # …after the launcher's repair, same binary, same file:
l2-ingest config OK (schema_version 1)                                  # exit 0
```

**Environment note, recorded not worked around.** Partway through this session
`/usr/bin/python3.12` in this container began blocking for exactly 30s on every exec
(`--version` costs 30s wall / 0.005s CPU; `-S` and `-v` stall identically with no output, so it
hangs before the interpreter starts). That makes the launcher suite appear to hang, because
`healthcheck.check_build` → `prereqs.find_engine_python()` probes interpreters on every run.
It is a container condition, not a repo defect — **the pre-fix source stalls identically**, and
`prereqs._run` already bounds each probe at 30s so it cannot hang indefinitely. Left alone:
shortening that bound could break a legitimately slow first `py -3.12` launch on Windows, and
there is no evidence here about what a safe lower bound would be.

**Gates:** launcher 257 → 276 tests, green. No other component was touched, so their gates are
unaffected and were not re-run.
