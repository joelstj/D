# CLAUDE.md

Engineering guide for the **L2 Data Ingestion Layer** — the read-path data-feed
component of a Cross-Chain Flash-Loan Arbitrage app, built and hardened by a
**Ralph loop**. This file orients any agent (or human) working in the repo. It is
checked-in project guidance: **treat the invariants below as binding.**

---

## 1. Start here (read in this order)

1. **`ralph/AGENTS.md`** — the standing, invariant rules. Read them **every**
   time. Breaking one is worse than making no progress.
2. **`ralph/PROMPT.md`** — the per-iteration build prompt.
3. **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — the design (one-process decision, data flow,
   crate layout, latency budget, reorg/verify, testing strategy).
4. **`docs/ENGINE_CONTRACT.md`** — how on-chain state maps onto the engine's JSON
   (V2/V3/V4, gas model, `native_price_in`, the `verified` honesty flag).
5. **`docs/reference/INTEGRATION.md`** — the engine team's contract, **verbatim
   and immutable**. Conform to it; never edit it.
6. **`ralph/PROGRESS.md`** — the loop's only memory: checklist, next task,
   BLOCKED items, per-iteration log. Update it every iteration.
7. **`docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`** — phased milestones M0–M10 with test-based exit
   criteria.

New to the repo? `README.md` → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## 2. The prime directives (invariant — never violate)

These come from `ralph/AGENTS.md` and **override any impulse to move faster**:

1. **Only real, on-chain-verifiable data.** Never invent, hardcode, mock, or
   "temporarily" fake reserves, prices, block hashes, gas, or addresses in any
   path that can reach a shipped artifact. Test fixtures are **recorded real**
   on-chain data at a **pinned block**, captured by a documented script.
2. **Never fake `verified:true`.** It means "reproducible from the canonical
   chain at the stamped `block_hash`, and the latest reconcile matched." If you
   can't prove it, it's `false`.
3. **Never reward-hack the tests.** Do not delete, `#[ignore]`, `--skip`, loosen
   an assertion, or narrow a fixture to go green. A test that legitimately can't
   run is marked **BLOCKED** in `PROGRESS.md` with a concrete reason — never
   faked green.
4. **Leave the build green.** Every commit must pass the Tier-A gate:
   `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -D warnings` +
   `cargo test --workspace`.
5. **One task per iteration.** Smallest safe step. Don't refactor unrelated code;
   don't start milestone N+1 while N has unmet exit criteria.
6. **Conform to the contract, don't change it.** `docs/reference/INTEGRATION.md`
   is immutable here. If reality seems to contradict it, record the discrepancy in
   `PROGRESS.md` and pick the contract.
7. **Respect the dependency order** (below). Don't build a layer on an untested one.
8. **Stay plug-and-play.** No hardcoded endpoints/addresses in code — they live in
   `config/`. Keep the output envelope stable and `/health` + `/metrics` intact.

---

## 3. What this component is (and is not)

A **single Rust process** that runs one supervised async **ingestor task per
chain** across five L2s, feeding one shared **aggregator** that assembles a
synchronized cross-chain snapshot and POSTs it to the `l2arb` Python detection
engine, then fans ranked opportunities out to a configurable output sink.

- **Chains:** Arbitrum One `42161`, Base `8453`, Optimism `10`, Unichain `130`,
  Ink `57073`.
- **It is a pure read path.** It **holds no keys, signs nothing, submits no
  transactions.** Signing, slippage protection, flash-loan callbacks, and MEV
  execution belong to the **separate** execution component — they are explicit
  **non-goals** here (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §11`). Do not add them.
- **The two headline decisions:** (1) one process, many chains — coherent
  simultaneous cross-chain view, isolated per-chain failure domains, one artifact;
  (2) Rust + `alloy` + `tokio` — no GC tail-latency, and the key trick: **read new
  pool state out of the event the node already pushed** (`Sync`/`Swap` logs carry
  post-trade reserves / `sqrtPrice`), so the hot path has **no extra RPC
  round-trip**.

---

## 4. Workspace & crate map

15 crates. Dependencies flow **downward**; this is also the milestone/build order,
so each layer leaves a green, self-contained base:

```
core → amm → rpc/chains → registry → ingest/v4 → gas → aggregator
     → engine-client → output → observability → config → app
```

| Crate | Package | Responsibility |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `crates/core` | `l2i-core` | Domain types + the engine JSON contract (`DetectRequest`/`Response`, `Pool`, `Token`, `Blockstamp`); `DecU256`/`DecI256` decimal-string serde; golden tests. |
| `crates/amm` | `l2i-amm` | Pure math (no I/O): V2 constant-product, V3/V4 TickMath (faithful `v3-core` port), `sqrtPriceX96→price`, `native_price_in`. |
| `crates/rpc` | `l2i-rpc` | `alloy` providers (WS subscribe / HTTP archive), Multicall3 `aggregate3`, batched `code_at_batch`, `PrefetchProvider` (batch-once-then-replay), rate-limit **failover** across comma-separated endpoints, reconnect+backoff, single-flight coalesce, `ChainProvider` trait, `MockProvider` (feature `testing`, Multicall3-aware + round-trip counter). |
| `crates/chains` | `l2i-chains` | Per-chain `ChainSpec`, gas model, canonical predeploy addresses (Multicall3, OP `GasPriceOracle`/`L1Block`, Arb `ArbGasInfo`). |
| `crates/registry` | `l2i-registry` | The **on-chain validation gate** (§7 of ARCHITECTURE) + pool-registry TOML loader + `sol!` ABI bindings + V4 `compute_pool_id`. |
| `crates/ingest` | `l2i-ingest` | Per-chain event decode (`Sync`/`Swap`/`Mint`/`Burn`), in-memory `Mirror` (DashMap), reorg tracker, reconcile, warm-start persist. |
| `crates/v4` | `l2i-v4` | Uniswap V4 adapter: `PoolManager` logs by `poolId`, `StateView` seed/reconcile, hook-safety gate, dynamic-fee read → emit as `v3` shape. |
| `crates/gas` | `l2i-gas` | Live gas + L1-data-fee reads (OP `getL1Fee`, Arbitrum `ArbGasInfo`), `assemble_chain_context`. **Lives above `rpc`** (it does RPC reads) to avoid a `chains↔rpc` cycle. |
| `crates/aggregator` | `l2i-aggregator` | Atomic per-chain snapshots (`re_stamp`), sync policy, `build_detect_request`, incremental tracker, cadence (debounce+heartbeat), `filter_cross_chain`. |
| `crates/engine-client` | `l2i-engine-client` | `EngineClient` trait; keep-alive HTTP impl + subprocess impl; `validate_response` (contract §10). |
| `crates/output` | `l2i-output` | Versioned `Envelope { schema_version, kind, chain_blocks, payload }`; `OutputSink` trait; stdout + WS-server sinks (redis/grpc are config surface, loudly `Unavailable`). |
| `crates/observability` | `l2i-observability` | Prometheus `/metrics`, `/health`, latency timers, tracing setup. |
| `crates/config` | `l2i-config` | Typed `Config` mirroring `config.example.toml`; `parse`/`load`/`validate`/`enabled_chains`. |
| `crates/app` | `l2-ingest` (bin) | The binary: load→validate→supervise→wire. `pipeline` (supervisor + aggregator loop), `ingestor` (live actor), `context` (cached per-chain gas/price on a `watch`), `crosschain`. |
| `crates/benches` | `l2i-benches` | Criterion hot-path benches (decode/apply/snapshot). |

---

## 5. The hot path (latency-critical — keep RPC off it)

```
node WS push (newHeads, logs)
  → decode event  (< 100 µs, alloy typed decode, no alloc)
  → update Mirror (< 50 µs, sharded DashMap)
  → aggregator: atomic per-chain snapshot + build DetectRequest (< 1 ms, incremental=deltas)
  → EngineClient keep-alive POST /detect
  → validate response → publish Envelope to sink
Intra-process budget (decode→emit): < 5 ms p99, CI-benched.
```

**Rules for anything on this path:**
- **No RPC round-trip per block.** `eth_call`/multicall is for **seeding** and
  **background reconciliation only**, run on off-loop workers (see
  `app/context.rs`, `ingest/reconcile.rs`). Never add a blocking RPC to the log/head
  handling loop.
- **No blocking calls in async tasks** (`std::thread::sleep`, blocking fs/IO). Use
  `tokio` equivalents. Blocking stalls log-draining and blows the latency budget.
- **Panic-safety is a system property.** The release profile is
  `panic = "abort"` (`Cargo.toml`), so a panic in **any** task aborts the **whole
  process** (all 5 chains) — the supervisor cannot catch it. Therefore the live
  path must **not panic**: prefer `Result` propagation over `.unwrap()`/`.expect()`/
  slice-indexing/unchecked-arithmetic on any input derived from chain data. Decoders
  already return `Result` and length-check — keep it that way.

---

## 6. Build, test, run

```bash
# Tier-A gate (must be green on every commit):
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace

# Build the binary + validate a config (no network needed):
cargo build --release
./target/release/l2-ingest --check-config --config config/config.example.toml

# Run against real endpoints (fill config.toml first; start l2arb once):
cp config/config.example.toml config.toml    # then fill RPC endpoints + pools
uvicorn l2arb.api.http:app --port 8080        # the engine, long-running
./target/release/l2-ingest --config config.toml

# Tier-B (live, not per-commit): benches + soak
cargo bench -p l2i-benches
L2I_LIVE=1 ./scripts/soak.sh
```

Toolchain is **pinned to Rust 1.94.1** (`rust-toolchain.toml`). `unsafe_code` is
`forbid` workspace-wide — this is a pure read path; no `unsafe` is warranted.

---

## 7. Engine-contract cheat-sheet (`docs/ENGINE_CONTRACT.md` is normative)

- **Only two pool kinds** the engine can price: `v2` (constant product) and `v3`
  (concentrated liquidity). **V4 pools map onto the `v3` shape**, identified by
  `poolId`. Anything the engine can't price (Curve/Balancer/Solidly-stable,
  fee-on-transfer/rebasing tokens, unsafe-hook V4) **must be excluded** and logged
  loudly at startup — feeding it in produces phantom opportunities, the worst
  failure mode.
- **Big integers are decimal strings, always** (`reserve*`, `sqrt_price_x96`,
  `liquidity`) — never JSON numbers (precision loss). Use `DecU256`/`DecI256`.
- **`fee_pips` is fee in millionths** (0.30% → 3000, 0.05% → 500).
- **`token0.address < token1.address`** byte-wise; `reserve0` pairs with `token0`.
  Do not re-sort.
- **`blockstamp` = `{ chain_id, number, block_hash, timestamp }`** — the
  `block_hash` is what makes state verifiable and reorg-aware.
- **"In sync"** = intra-chain single-block (never mix block N and N−1 for one
  chain in a request) + freshest-verified-per-chain.
- **`native_price_in[T]`** is a float ratio derived from the ingested WETH/T pool
  (numeraire-base-units per 1 wei of native). `f64` here is **contract-conformant**
  — the only place floats are acceptable. A numeraire with no derivable path is
  omitted.
- **Cadence:** build+send on meaningful change with a `min_interval_ms` debounce
  floor and a `max_interval_ms` heartbeat ceiling. **First request of a session is
  `incremental: false`; then `true`.** After a reconnect/reseed, the incremental
  tracker/policy must reset so the next request is full again.
- **Response handling (§10):** confirm every leg was `verified:true`, `net_profit >
  0`, and blockstamps round-trip. A bad/non-200/schema-invalid response is a failed
  tick — log, count the error metric, keep the last good snapshot; **never crash the
  ingestor.**

---

## 8. Invariants to preserve when editing

Breaking any of these is a correctness/safety regression:

- **`verified` honesty** — a pool that is reorg-in-flight, reconnecting/reseeding,
  reconcile-mismatched, or has an unpinnable dynamic fee/hook **must** emit
  `verified:false`. Never emit stale or unproven state as `verified:true`.
- **The validation gate is the security boundary** (`registry/gate.rs`). Every
  configured pool must pass code-exists → token0/1 → fee → deny-list →
  decimals/symbol → factory (V4: hook-safety → poolId) or it does not enter the
  live set. A logged-but-not-enforced check is a bypass.
- **No RPC on the hot path;** off-loop workers only (see §5).
- **Atomic per-chain snapshots;** never mix two blocks of one chain in a request.
- **The output envelope is stable** and versioned (`schema_version`). Downstream
  consumers depend on it.
- **Decimal-string big-ints** everywhere in the contract; the golden serde tests
  guard this.

---

## 9. Testing strategy & fixtures

Two tiers (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §9`). **Only Tier A gates the loop** (deterministic).

- **Tier A (every commit, 100% green):** unit + property (`proptest`) + the
  backbone **on-chain equality tests** — *event-derived mirror state == independent
  `eth_call` at a pinned block, exactly* — plus reorg/reconcile/contract-serde
  tests. Fixtures are **recorded real** on-chain data at pinned blocks
  (`crates/*/tests/fixtures/*.json`), captured on-chain — never hand-typed.
- **Tier B (nightly / pre-release, not per-commit):** criterion latency benches
  vs the §8 budget, a live soak (continuous reconcile stays 100%, no memory growth,
  reconnect exercised), and an e2e plug-and-play run against live endpoints + a real
  `l2arb`.

When adding a behavior, add the test named in the milestone's exit criteria. For
anything touching chain data, the proof is the pinned-block equality test.

---

## 10. Current status

**M0–M10 complete + a post-M10 production-audit hardening pass.** Tier-A is green
on HEAD (build + `clippy -D warnings` + `fmt --check` + 145+ tests; benches far
under the §8 budget; live HTTP smoke green on all 5 chains). See `ralph/PROGRESS.md`
for the authoritative checklist and per-iteration log.

**NOT `RALPH-COMPLETE`** — the sentinel additionally requires the two Tier-B gates,
both **BLOCKED** in this environment and recorded honestly (never faked green):
1. the real `l2arb` engine (not on PyPI here) → blocks the M8 real-engine contract
   test + M10 e2e;
2. a WebSocket L2 endpoint (public RPCs are HTTP-only here) → blocks the M1
   `newHeads`/`logs`-over-WS smoke + the sustained soak.

To close them, provide the engine (`[engine].http_url`/`subprocess_cmd`) and an
`L2I_WS_<chain_id>` endpoint, run the e2e + `scripts/soak.sh`, and only then append
the `RALPH-COMPLETE` line with an evidence summary.

---

## 11. Non-obvious decisions & gotchas

- **`gas` is above `rpc`, not in `chains`.** The build plan sketches gas adapters
  in `chains`, but `chains` is depended-on by `rpc`; adapters that do RPC reads must
  live above `rpc`. Predeploy **address constants** stay in `chains`.
- **V4 emits `kind:"v3"`.** V4's concentrated-liquidity math is identical to V3;
  only the *identity* (`poolId`) and *read path* (`StateView`/`PoolManager`) differ.
- **`f64` appears only in `native_price_in` derivation** — that ratio is a JSON
  float in the contract. All swap-relevant amounts stay `U256` decimal strings.
- **`panic = "abort"` + supervisor** — see §5. Panic-safety on the live path is
  mandatory, not stylistic.
- **redis/grpc sinks are config surface, not built** — they return a loud
  `Unavailable`. ws + stdout are the shipped sinks.
- **Off-loop reads are batched, not per-item.** Seeding, the validation gate
  (via `rpc::PrefetchProvider` — batch every read once, then replay the existing
  per-pool `validate_pool` offline), and reconcile (grouped by block) all go
  through Multicall3 `aggregate3` + a batched `eth_getCode`. When adding a new
  off-loop read path, batch it too — don't reintroduce one request per pool.
- **Endpoint failover ≠ retry-everything.** `rpc::failover` hands off to the next
  comma-separated endpoint only on rate-limit/transport errors; a revert/decode
  error must **propagate** (every endpoint returns it identically). Don't widen
  `is_failover_error` to swallow real results.
- **Do not edit `docs/reference/INTEGRATION.md`.**
